# Production Deployment

---
# Environments
---

## What Does Production Mean?

1. Your production environment is what your customers actually use <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. We don't test new features or fixes in production <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Typically we have several environments: one for development, one for testing and/or performance testing, a "staging" environment, and production <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Development

1. Developers use the development environment to work on new features or bug fixes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. It's ok for things to be broken, but you have to converge as a release date approaches <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Staging

1. Staging contains your production-candidate code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Has passed code reviews and test cases <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Managers who don't build the code want to sanity-check it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## How Do We Make Environments?

1. A common approach is "Infrastructure as Code" in which we write code to generate the environment from bare metal <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. A popular system is Terraform, in which a Domain-Specific Language is used to create an environment from bare metal <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# Release Methodologies
---

## Waterfall

1. In "waterfall" planning, we write specs as completely as possible to describe the behavior end-users see, and how the code will accomplish that. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. This is time-consuming, but when lives are at stake, it's worth it. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. If lives aren't at stake, waterfall plans can become obsolete as requirements change. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Agile

1. In "agile" development, we try for short-term wins because making a year-long plan won't work anyway <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. The team has a daily "standup" to communicate needs, blockers, heads-up <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Release schedules are 2-3 week "sprints" which culminate in a deployment to production <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Problems with Agile

1. Commonly used "story points" are an imprecise way to estimate scope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. It's hard to schedule work which takes longer than a sprint <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. It's hard to plan a project from scratch. Easier to improve a running system <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Reality

1. Organizations pick-and-choose from methodologies which fit their culture and project scope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Choose the right tool for the job <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Project planning is hard

1. Hofstadter's Law: Everything takes longer than you think, even after taking Hofstadter's Law into account <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Fred Brooks: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Iron Triangle: Good, fast, cheap. Choose two. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Conway's Law: Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Security
---

## Out of Bounds (OOB)

1. If you know where a secret lives in memory <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Find code which operates on adjacent memory <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Look for an opportunity to read past the end of the buffer, capturing the secret <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Stack Overflow <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Remote Code Execution

1. Load your malicious code into memory somehow <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. When functions return to their caller, the return address is on the stack <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Look for code which manipulates that address and replace it with the address of your code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Log4J <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Supply Chain Attacks

1. Find/guess the password of a developer who has permission to push to a repo <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Add a bunch of innocent-looking (or super obscure) code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Get the company's dev ops team to distribute your malware for you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Solar Winds <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## SQL injection

1. If your system accepts input from a user, a malicious user could tailor the input to attack you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Enter name: Phil ;DROP TABLE users; <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Never trust form data from users <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Password Storage

1. An attacker or disgruntled employee could get access to passwords <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Don't store them in clear text, or using reversible encryption <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Use a one-way hash algorithm to store passwords, e.g. PBKDF2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
# High Availability
---

## Protocols

1. HTTP is stateless - future operations can't depend on past operations <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Idempotency - operations should have the same result no matter how many times they run, say after an error <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Networks

1. Redundancy - if one server/rack/datacenter goes offline fail over to an HA partner in another server/rack/datacenter <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Georouting - DNS is used to route traffic to the DC closest to your IP address (e.g. Akamai) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Load Balancing

1. Load Balancers face the public Internet and accept incoming HTTP requests <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Requests may be forwarded to an application server in round-robin, or least-load <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Reverse Proxies

1. If a proxy server sits on a private network, caching web pages, a reverse proxy sits in a datacenter, caching database reads <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. LB and Proxy are sometimes combined <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Redis is a common caching solution <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Database Performance

With a sufficiently large database

1. Database Sharding -  the key/index space must be distributed across many machines <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Read Replicas - Read results can be cached to reduce load on databases <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Consistency - DB writes need a careful policy. Update all read replicas [now|eventually|on read] <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# When Things Go Wrong

## Debugging

1. Containerized deployment <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Log aggregators collect and graph KPIs: request rate, response latency, error rate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Splunk is a commonly used tool <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Who Watches for Problems?

1. Monitoring KPIs for dangerous thresholds has to wake someone up in the middle of the night <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. PEP - are customers seeing a problem? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Load Average is the average number of processes waiting to be scheduled <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Uptime Targets

1. Uptime is usually measured in end-user minutes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Teams frequently make promises about how much uptime they will have: 99%, 99.9%, etc. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Five Nines (99.999%) is possible but expensive. Does the revenue stream justify that? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Service Level Agreements

1. Teams make promises about how many minutes to respond to a problem, resolve the problem, and identify the root cause <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Developers may need to be "on call" and available to diagnose problems <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Pager Duty is a commonly used tool <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Observations

1. Things go wrong all the time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. What matters is that you and you and your code get better over time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. My motto: All New Mistakes! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
