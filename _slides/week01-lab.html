# The Go Toolchain

# Command-Line Tools

1. When you install go, the command line program `go` is present in `/usr/local/go/bin/`
1. `go` can:
    - build your programs (like `gcc` and `make`)
    - test your programs using test cases you develop
    - install new programs 
    - format your code
    - and much more (but not debug!)

# Debugging

1. Sometimes, you'll be able to debug using `fmt.print()` (like C `printf()`)
1. Sometimes, you'll need a real debugger
1. In `go` the debugger is called `dlv` ("delve") and it works mostly like `gdb`
1. Whether you debug from the command line or from VS Code, you're using the same `dlv`

# Go History

1. When Go was invented, they designed it so all the tools and source code were in one directory
1. This somewhat mirrors the way Google uses Go [internally](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2854146)

# `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`

1. When searching for information about programming Go, you'll find references to environment variables `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`
1. We aren't going to use them, but the context is good to know
1. When you use `go install` to install `dlv` or VS Code extensions, they are installed into `GOPATH`
1. If you don't specify a `GOPATH` the default path is `~/go/`. I recommend you leave that alone.

---
# Go Modules

1. The new way to write Go without putting all source code in the same directory is to use "modules"
1. `go mod` provides a way to analyze dependencies and reduce conflicts
1. We will use modules, not the old `GOPATH` mechanism
