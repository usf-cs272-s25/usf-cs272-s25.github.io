# Intro to Go
---

# Hello World

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World")
}
```
---
# Observations

1. All source files begin with `package` and the name of the package
1. `import` means both introduce the name **and** the implementation (like python, not like C)
1. `fmt` is the [package](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) to use to output formatted text 
1. The format shown for braces is required (open `{` on the next line is illegal)
1. Unused imports are illegal

---
# Scalar Types

1. `int`, `uint`, `bool`, `byte` (like C)
1. `rune` means a single UTF-8 character, e.g. é or å

---
# Go is strongly-typed

```go
var i int = 0
var j uint = 1
j = i  // incompatible assignment
i = j  // incompatible assignment

j = uint(i)  // works but ugly. think twice

var b bool = false
b = i  // incompatible assignment
```
1. The order is `name type` not `type name` like C
2. Unused variables are illegal

---
# Zero initialization

```go
var i int
fmt.Println("i: ", i)

var s string
fmt.Println("s: ", s)
```
1. All variables (scalars, strings, structs, ...) are automatically initialized to zero

---
# Short Declaration

```go
i := 1
s := "foo"
thing := calcThing()
```
1. Declare a variable with the type of the thing on the right
2. You won't need `var` very much. `:=` is idiomatic.

---
# Arrays

To declare an array:
```go
var arr [3]int
```
To declare and initialize:
```go
arr := [3]int{2, 4, 6}
```
1. Array length is immutable
1. Array references are bounds-checked

---
# Slices

Slices are variable-length references
```go
s := []int{}
s = append(s, 1)
```
1. Declare a slice and initializes its length to zero
1. `append` manipulates the underlying array, reallocating as necessary
1. In C: `int **ppi;`

---
# Bounds Checking

```go
arr := [3]int
i := arr[4] // panics the go runtime
```

---
# Looping
```go
for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
    fmt.Printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", i,  arr[i])
}

for idx, val := range arr {
    fmt.Printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", idx, val)
}
```
1. `range` is an idiomatic way to refer to the index and the value
1. `len` gives the logical length of a slice (or `string` or `map`)

---
# For is the only looping construct
```go
var idx int
for {
    if idx == len(arr) {
        break
    }
    fmt.Printf("arr[%d] = %d\n", arr[idx])
    idx++
}
```
---
# Functions

```go
func add2(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```
1. Use the `func` keyword
1. Multiple params of same type
1. Return type follows params
1. Exported names are capitalized, e.g. `Add2()`
