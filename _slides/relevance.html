# Relevance Ranking

Problem statement: 
- Some search hits are more relevant than others
- How can we compute an ordering for the hits? 

---

# Term Frequency

The more times a search term appears in a document, the more relevant that document is as a search hit (obvs?)

---

# Term Frequency 2

- Search<sub>1</sub>: 5 occurrences in a document containing 1,000,000 words
- Search<sub>2</sub>: 3 occurrences in a document containing 1,000 words
- Which hit is more relevant?

--- 

# Term Frequency 3

TF = occurrences of term / words in that document

---

# Document Frequency

- Search<sub>1</sub>: Search term appears in one document in a corpus of 10,000 documents
- Search<sub>2</sub>: Search term appears in 9,000 documents of the same corpus
- Which hit is more relevant?

---

# Document Frequency 2

- DF = number of documents in which search term occurs
- Mental Model: how much information is represented by a search term?
- Proposed by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Sp%C3%A4rck_Jones target="_blank">Karen Sp√§rck Jones</a>

---

# Document Frequency 3

- If a search term appears in a small fraction of the documents, its frequency is a small number
- To combine Term Frequency with Document Frequency, what can we do to it?
- IDF = log(#docs in corpus / (#docs containing term + 1)) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# TF-IDF

- Relevance = Term Frequency * **Inverse** Document Frequency
- Should produce a small number between 0.0 (not relevant) and low integers (very relevant)

---

# PageRank

- Google's Larry Page <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank target="_blank">proposed</a> that relevance 
on the World Wide Web is a function of how many pages hyperlink to a page
- Normalized by how many outbound links are on that page (just like TF)
- What pros or cons do you see to this approach?

---

# Machine Learning

- In a world where ML applications are in high demand, we need oodles of accurately-labeled data to train the models
- How does this relate to "information retrieval" techniques like TF-IDF or PageRank?
