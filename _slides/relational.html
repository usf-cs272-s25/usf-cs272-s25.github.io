# Databases

---

## Problem statement

1. Since the index for a useful search engine is too large to fit in RAM
we have to write it onto a disk (or a lot of disks)
1. We need a way to query the database and get results back
1. Use a database!

---

## Flavors 

The universe of databases is divided into approaches:

1. Relational Databases use _Tables_ where each row is an entry 
and each column is an attribute of that entry.
1. Non-Relational databases, where _Documents_ contain Attributes

---

## Relational DBs

1. Rely on a _Schema_ which contains rules about which tables can contain which attributes
1. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity target="_blank">Referential Integrity</a> enforces 
the relationships defined in the schema
1. We can create, update (modify) and delete elements of a table, as long as 
the changes obey the rules specified in the schema
1. Can you imagine some pros or cons?

---

## Document DBs

1. If your data isn't relational, perhaps the rigidity of a relational DB isn't helpful
1. Maybe it's not important that all documents contain the same attributes
1. Imagine a database which indexes <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON target="_blank">JSON</a> documents
1. How might our search engine use a Document DB?

---

## Scalability

1. If you're building a search engine for a company, **vertical scalability** 
(bigger disk, faster computer) might be enough
1. If you're building a global-scale search engine, **horizontal scalability**
(more computers, more disks) will be required

---

## ACID Transactions 

1. Atomicity - if a transaction starts, it finishes
1. Consistency - all computers contain the same data
1. Isolation - concurrent and sequential results match
1. Durability - transaction results are permanent

Proposed by [Jim Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist))

---

## Pro Tip

1. Yes, relational DBs can be a drag, but
1. The stronger your ACID requirements are, the more you need a relational DB
1. Choose the right tool for the job

---

## CS 272

1. We will use a relational DB for this course, even though a search 
engine is not a classically relational problem
1. Hopefully the exposure will be valuable

# Relational Modeling

proposed by [Ted Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd)
---

## Entities

1. Entities are the tables in a database
1. Programmers tend to make complex data structures
1. Simplify each struct into an entity, unrolling lists/slices, maps, etc.

---

## Object-oriented view

```go
type Product struct {
    product_name string
    unit_price float
}

type Manufacturer struct {
    mfg_name string
    products []Product
}
```

---

## Relational view 1

| mfg_name    |
| ----------- |
| Widgets Inc |

| product_name | unit_price |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Sprocket     |       9.99 |
| Gadget       |      14.99 |

Problems?

---

## Relationships

Relationships describe how entities interact
- Has One
- Has Many
- Unique
- Non-null
- "Has Birthdate"

What problem do these solve?

---

## Relational view 2

| id | mfg_name    |
| -- | ----------- |
|  1 | Widgets Inc |

| id | mfg_id | product_name | unit_price |
| -- | ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
|  1 |      1 | Sprocket     |       9.99 |
|  2 |      1 | Gadget       |      14.99 |

## Entity Relationships 

1. ER diagrams help define a schema
1. Always start a project with an ER diagram
1. How might our search engine use ER diagram?

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model target="_blank">Proposed</a> by 
Peter Chen

---

## Cardinality

1. Refers to the number of relationships between one entity and another
1. Drawn using [crow's foot notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model#Crow's_foot_notation)
1. How might our search engine use cardinality?

---

## Principles

1. Unroll data structures into one table per struct type
1. Every row has a _Primary Key_ which is unique in that table
1. _Normalize_ data by eliminating redundancy (see [BCNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyce%E2%80%93Codd_normal_form))
1. _Foreign Keys_ "point back" to a related table by ID

# Structured Query Language (SQL)

---

## About SQL
1. SQL is a programming language to describe tables, attributes, and constraints
1. Many databases support SQL (Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, PostgreSQL, SQLite, ...)
1. The syntax is arcane but SQL is everywhere in commercial SW dev

---

## Creating Tables

<br>

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text
);
```

---

## Inserting rows

<br>

```sql
INSERT INTO customers(name) values("Widgets Inc");
```

What about the `id`?

---

## Updating (modifying) rows

<br>

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET zip_code = 95070
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## Querying (searching)

<br>

```sql
SELECT * from customers;

SELECT * from customers WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## Deleting rows and tables

<br>

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;

DROP TABLE customers;
```

SQL Injection

---

## Foreign Keys

```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    amount real,
    customer_id integer,
    FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE customer_id = 1;
```
