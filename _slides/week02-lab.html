# Lab02 Topics

---

## HTML Parsing

1. Review the [example code](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html#Parse) to see how to call the HTML parser and traverse the resulting tree
1. Review the struct definition for an [`html.Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html#Node) to see that `TextNode` types contain user-visible text in their `Data`.

## URL Cleaning

1. Problem: URLs in markup can be absolute, e.g. http://www.example.com/index.html or partial (/index.html)
1. Your web crawler will need a way to turn a partial URL into a an absolute URL
1. URL parsing is complex but Go provides a [URL struct](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#URL) and parser you can use.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

---

## Start with the tests
1. What does correct behavior look like?
1. How can we prevent regressions?
1. Positive and negative test cases

---

## In the professional world
1. All commits need to prove they don't break anything
1. Bug fixes need to add a test case
1. Automated test suites can/should grow very large

---

## Go has a testing mechanism
1. `go test` invokes your test cases
1. If you have a function `Foo()` in `foo.go`, you should have `TestFoo()` in `foo_test.go`
1. Your test code will be executed by the `Testing` package, not by your `main()`

---

## In CS 272

1. You will write test cases for  your code
1. You will maintain the test cases as the project increases in complexity
1. Write good test cases - assignments will include rubric for effective test cases
