<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:<br/>
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,<br/>
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,<br/>
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a
tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no need
of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Am I like such a fellow?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as soon
moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
And what to?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MERCUTIO.<br/>
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill
the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a
hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for
cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of
quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle
as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the
street, because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst
thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me
from quarrelling!
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of
my life for an hour and a quarter.
</p>

</p>

Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO.<br/>
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;<br/>
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink<br/>
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal<br/>
Your high displeasure. All this uttered<br/>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d<br/>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br/>
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br/>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,<br/>
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br/>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br/>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br/>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity<br/>
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,<br/>
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,<br/>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br/>
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br/>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br/>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.<br/>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br/>
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,<br/>
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I<br/>
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;<br/>
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.<br/>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
He is a kinsman to the Montague.<br/>
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.<br/>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br/>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br/>
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;<br/>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

The life of Tybalt.

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
And for that offence<br/>
Immediately we do exile him hence.<br/>
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,<br/>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.<br/>
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br/>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.<br/>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br/>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.<br/>
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,<br/>
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.<br/>
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.<br/>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br/>
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner<br/>

And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br/>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br/>
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo<br/>
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.<br/>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br/>
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,<br/>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br/>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<br/>
And learn me how to lose a winning match,<br/>
Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.<br/>
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,<br/>
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,<br/>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br/>
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br/>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br/>
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.<br/>
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,<br/>

More honourable state, more courtship lives<br/>

Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,<br/>
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,<br/>

LADY CAPULET.<br/>
You are too hot.

CAPULET.<br/>
God’s bread, it makes me mad!<br/>
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,<br/>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br/>
To have her match’d, and having now provided<br/>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br/>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,<br/>
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,<br/>
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,<br/>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br/>
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,<br/>
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,<br/>
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’<br/>
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.<br/>
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.<br/>
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.<br/>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.<br/>
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;<br/>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,<br/>
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,<br/>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.<br/>
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.

JULIET.<br/>
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br/>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br/>
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,<br/>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,<br/>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br/>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY CAPULET.<br/>
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.<br/>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

JULIET.<br/>
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br/>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.<br/>
How shall that faith return again to earth,<br/>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br/>
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.<br/>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br/>
Upon so soft a subject as myself.<br/>
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br/>
Some comfort, Nurse.

NURSE.<br/>
Faith, here it is.<br/>
Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing<br/>
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.<br/>
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br/>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br/>
I think it best you married with the County.<br/>
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.<br/>
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,<br/>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br/>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br/>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br/>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br/>
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,<br/>
As living here and you no use of him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Speakest thou from thy heart?
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
And from my soul too,<br/>
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET.<br/>
Amen.

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
What?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br/>
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,<br/>
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,<br/>
To make confession and to be absolv’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br/>
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET.<br/>
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br/>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br/>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br/>
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare<br/>
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.<br/>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br/>
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.<br/>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
