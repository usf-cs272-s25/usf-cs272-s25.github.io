<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,<br/>
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.<br/>
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;<br/>
And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit<br/>
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.<br/>
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—<br/>
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—<br/>
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,<br/>
That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.<br/>
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,<br/>
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Balthasar</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?<br/>
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?<br/>
How doth my lady? Is my father well?<br/>
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;<br/>
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br/>
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.<br/>
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,<br/>
And her immortal part with angels lives.<br/>
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,<br/>
And presently took post to tell it you.<br/>
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,<br/>
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!<br/>
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,<br/>
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br/>
I do beseech you sir, have patience.<br/>
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import<br/>
Some misadventure.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.<br/>
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.<br/>
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br/>
No, my good lord.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
No matter. Get thee gone,<br/>
And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit <span class="charname">Balthasar</span>.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.<br/>
Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift<br/>
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.<br/>
I do remember an apothecary,—<br/>
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted<br/>
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br/>
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,<br/>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;<br/>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br/>
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins<br/>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<br/>
A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br/>
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,<br/>
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses<br/>
Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.<br/>
Noting this penury, to myself I said,<br/>
And if a man did need a poison now,<br/>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br/>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.<br/>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,<br/>
And this same needy man must sell it me.<br/>
As I remember, this should be the house.<br/>
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.<br/>
What, ho! Apothecary!
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Apothecary</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
APOTHECARY.<br/>
Who calls so loud?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.<br/>
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have<br/>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br/>
As will disperse itself through all the veins,<br/>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,<br/>
And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath<br/>
As violently as hasty powder fir’d<br/>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
</p>

<p class="drama">
APOTHECARY.<br/>
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law<br/>
Is death to any he that utters them.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<br/>
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,<br/>
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,<br/>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.<br/>
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;<br/>
The world affords no law to make thee rich;<br/>
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
</p>

<p class="drama">
APOTHECARY.<br/>
My poverty, but not my will consents.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
</p>

<p class="drama">
APOTHECARY.<br/>
Put this in any liquid thing you will<br/>
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength<br/>
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,<br/>
Doing more murder in this loathsome world<br/>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<br/>
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.<br/>
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br/>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br/>
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

<p class="drama">
FRIAR JOHN.<br/>
Going to find a barefoot brother out,<br/>
One of our order, to associate me,<br/>
Here in this city visiting the sick,<br/>
And finding him, the searchers of the town,<br/>
Suspecting that we both were in a house<br/>
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<br/>
Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,<br/>
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR JOHN.<br/>
I could not send it,—here it is again,—<br/>
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<br/>
So fearful were they of infection.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,<br/>
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,<br/>
Of dear import, and the neglecting it<br/>
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,<br/>
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight<br/>
Unto my cell.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR JOHN.<br/>
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Now must I to the monument alone.<br/>
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.<br/>
She will beshrew me much that Romeo<br/>
Hath had no notice of these accidents;<br/>
But I will write again to Mantua,<br/>
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.<br/>
Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.

Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof<br/>
And do not interrupt me in my course.<br/>
Why I descend into this bed of death<br/>
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,<br/>
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br/>
A precious ring, a ring that I must use<br/>
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.<br/>
But if thou jealous dost return to pry<br/>
In what I further shall intend to do,<br/>
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,<br/>
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.<br/>

ROMEO.<br/>
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.<br/>
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!<br/>
What said my man, when my betossed soul<br/>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br/>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.<br/>
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?<br/>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br/>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br/>
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.<br/>
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.<br/>
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,<br/>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br/>
This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br/>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.

How oft when men are at the point of death<br/>
Have they been merry! Which their keepers call<br/>
A lightning before death. O, how may I<br/>
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,<br/>
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,<br/>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br/>
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet<br/>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br/>
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.<br/>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br/>
O, what more favour can I do to thee<br/>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br/>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br/>
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,<br/>
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe<br/>
That unsubstantial death is amorous;<br/>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br/>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br/>
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,<br/>
And never from this palace of dim night<br/>
Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br/>
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br/>
Will I set up my everlasting rest;<br/>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br/>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.<br/>
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you<br/>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br/>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.<br/>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.<br/>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br/>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.<br/>
Here’s to my love! [<i>Drinks.</i>] O true apothecary!<br/>

LADY CAPULET.<br/>
O me! This sight of death is as a bell<br/>
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Montague</span> and others.</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,<br/>
To see thy son and heir more early down.

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.<br/>
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.<br/>
What further woe conspires against mine age?
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Look, and thou shalt see.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,<br/>
To press before thy father to a grave?
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,<br/>
Till we can clear these ambiguities,<br/>
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,<br/>
And then will I be general of your woes,<br/>
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,<br/>
And let mischance be slave to patience.<br/>
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
I am the greatest, able to do least,<br/>
Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br/>
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.<br/>
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br/>
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br/>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br/>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,<br/>
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.<br/>
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day<br/>
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death<br/>
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;<br/>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.<br/>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br/>
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce<br/>
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,<br/>
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means<br/>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br/>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br/>
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,<br/>
A sleeping potion, which so took effect<br/>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<br/>
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br/>
That he should hither come as this dire night<br/>
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,<br/>
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.<br/>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br/>
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight<br/>
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone<br/>
At the prefixed hour of her waking<br/>
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,<br/>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br/>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br/>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br/>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br/>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br/>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth<br/>
And bear this work of heaven with patience.<br/>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br/>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br/>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br/>
All this I know; and to the marriage<br/>
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this<br/>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br/>
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,<br/>
Unto the rigour of severest law.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
We still have known thee for a holy man.<br/>
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BALTHASAR.<br/>
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,<br/>
And then in post he came from Mantua<br/>
To this same place, to this same monument.<br/>
This letter he early bid me give his father,<br/>
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,<br/>
If I departed not, and left him there.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
Give me the letter, I will look on it.<br/>
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?<br/>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
</p>

<p class="drama">
PAGE.<br/>
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,<br/>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.<br/>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,<br/>
And by and by my master drew on him,<br/>
And then I ran away to call the watch.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,<br/>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.<br/>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br/>
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal<br/>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br/>
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,<br/>
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br/>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!<br/>
And I, for winking at your discords too,<br/>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br/>
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more<br/>
Can I demand.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
But I can give thee more,<br/>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,<br/>
That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br/>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<br/>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,<br/>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PRINCE.<br/>
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br/>
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br/>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.<br/>
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,<br/>
For never was a story of more woe<br/>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
