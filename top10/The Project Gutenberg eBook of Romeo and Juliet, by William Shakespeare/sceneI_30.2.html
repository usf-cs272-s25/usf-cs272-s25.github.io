Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

No, for then we should be colliers.

I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY.<br/>
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON.<br/>
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GREGORY.<br/>
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away.
</p>

SAMPSON.<br/>
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.<br/>
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.

GREGORY.<br/>
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br/>
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men
from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.

GREGORY.<br/>
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
</p>

SAMPSON.<br/>
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought
with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.

GREGORY.<br/>
The heads of the maids?
</p>

<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br/>
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.

GREGORY.<br/>
They must take it in sense that feel it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SAMPSON.<br/>
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
</p>

’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor

Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br/>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br/>
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground<br/>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br/>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br/>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br/>
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,<br/>
And made Verona’s ancient citizens<br/>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br/>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br/>
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.<br/>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br/>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br/>

Here were the servants of your adversary<br/>

I drew to part them, in the instant came<br/>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,<br/>
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,<br/>
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,<br/>
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.<br/>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows<br/>
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br/>
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

<p class="drama">
LADY MONTAGUE.<br/>
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?<br/>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun<br/>
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,<br/>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,<br/>
Where underneath the grove of sycamore<br/>
That westward rooteth from this city side,<br/>
So early walking did I see your son.<br/>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,<br/>
And stole into the covert of the wood.<br/>
I, measuring his affections by my own,<br/>
Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br/>
Being one too many by my weary self,<br/>
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,<br/>
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br/>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,<br/>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br/>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br/>
Should in the farthest east begin to draw<br/>
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,<br/>
Away from light steals home my heavy son,<br/>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<br/>
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out<br/>
And makes himself an artificial night.<br/>
Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br/>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Have you importun’d him by any means?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MONTAGUE.<br/>
Both by myself and many other friends;<br/>
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,<br/>
Is to himself—I will not say how true—<br/>
But to himself so secret and so close,<br/>
So far from sounding and discovery,<br/>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br/>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<br/>
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br/>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br/>
We would as willingly give cure as know.

Of love?

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Out of her favour where I am in love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Alas that love so gentle in his view,<br/>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,<br/>
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!<br/>
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br/>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br/>
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:<br/>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br/>
O anything, of nothing first create!<br/>
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br/>
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br/>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!<br/>
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!<br/>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br/>
Dost thou not laugh?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
No coz, I rather weep.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Good heart, at what?
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
At thy good heart’s oppression.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Why such is love’s transgression.<br/>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br/>
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest<br/>
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown<br/>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br/>
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;<br/>
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;<br/>
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:<br/>
What is it else? A madness most discreet,<br/>
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br/>
Farewell, my coz.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Going.</i>]</p>

Soft! I will go along:<br/>
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.<br/>
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.

BENVOLIO.<br/>
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.

ROMEO.<br/>
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,<br/>
A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.<br/>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO.<br/>
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>

</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit<br/>
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;<br/>
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,<br/>
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.<br/>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms<br/>
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,<br/>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<br/>
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor<br/>
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br/>
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;<br/>
For beauty starv’d with her severity,<br/>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br/>
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,<br/>
To merit bliss by making me despair.<br/>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br/>
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
</p>

<p class="drama">
BENVOLIO.<br/>
Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.
</p>

ROMEO.<br/>
O teach me how I should forget to think.
</p>

BENVOLIO.<br/>
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;<br/>
Examine other beauties.
</p>

ROMEO.<br/>
’Tis the way<br/>
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.<br/>
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,<br/>
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;<br/>
He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br/>
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.<br/>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br/>
What doth her beauty serve but as a note<br/>
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?<br/>
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br/>
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes<br/>
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<br/>
On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br/>
Drawn with a team of little atomies<br/>
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:<br/>
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;<br/>
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;<br/>
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;<br/>
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;<br/>
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;<br/>
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,<br/>
Not half so big as a round little worm<br/>
Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:<br/>
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br/>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br/>
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.<br/>
And in this state she gallops night by night<br/>
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;<br/>
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;<br/>
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br/>
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br/>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br/>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<br/>
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,<br/>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br/>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,<br/>
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,<br/>
Then dreams he of another benefice:<br/>
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,<br/>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br/>
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,<br/>
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon<br/>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;<br/>
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,<br/>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br/>
That plats the manes of horses in the night;<br/>
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,<br/>
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<br/>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br/>
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,<br/>
Making them women of good carriage:<br/>
This is she,—
