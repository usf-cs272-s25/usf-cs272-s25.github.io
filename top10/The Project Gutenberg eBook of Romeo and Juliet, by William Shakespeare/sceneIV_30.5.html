FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
My father Capulet will have it so;<br/>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.<br/>
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,<br/>
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;<br/>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br/>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br/>
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;<br/>
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,<br/>
To stop the inundation of her tears,<br/>
Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br/>
May be put from her by society.<br/>
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
</p>

<p class="drama">

JULIET.<br/>
What must be shall be.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
That’s a certain text.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Come you to make confession to this father?
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
To answer that, I should confess to you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Do not deny to him that you love me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
I will confess to you that I love him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
If I do so, it will be of more price,<br/>
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
The tears have got small victory by that;<br/>
For it was bad enough before their spite.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,<br/>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
It may be so, for it is not mine own.<br/>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,<br/>
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—<br/>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
God shield I should disturb devotion!—<br/>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,<br/>
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,<br/>
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br/>
It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br/>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br/>
On Thursday next be married to this County.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,<br/>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br/>
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<br/>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br/>
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.<br/>
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;<br/>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,<br/>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br/>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br/>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br/>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,<br/>
Give me some present counsel, or behold<br/>
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br/>
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that<br/>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br/>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br/>
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,<br/>
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,<br/>
Which craves as desperate an execution<br/>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br/>
If, rather than to marry County Paris<br/>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br/>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br/>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br/>
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.<br/>
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br/>
From off the battlements of yonder tower,<br/>
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br/>
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;<br/>
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,<br/>
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,<br/>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.<br/>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,<br/>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;<br/>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,<br/>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br/>
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent<br/>
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;<br/>
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,<br/>
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br/>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br/>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,<br/>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br/>
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse<br/>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.<br/>
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,<br/>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br/>
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,<br/>
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.<br/>
Each part depriv’d of supple government,<br/>
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.<br/>
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death<br/>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<br/>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br/>
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br/>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br/>
Then as the manner of our country is,<br/>
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,<br/>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br/>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br/>
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,<br/>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br/>
And hither shall he come, and he and I<br/>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br/>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br/>
And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br/>
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br/>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous<br/>
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed<br/>
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
</p>

<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br/>
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.<br/>
Farewell, dear father.

<p class="drama">
What if it be a poison, which the Friar<br/>
Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,<br/>
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,<br/>
Because he married me before to Romeo?<br/>
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,<br/>
For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br/>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br/>
I wake before the time that Romeo<br/>
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!<br/>
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,<br/>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br/>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br/>
Or, if I live, is it not very like,<br/>
The horrible conceit of death and night,<br/>
Together with the terror of the place,<br/>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,<br/>
Where for this many hundred years the bones<br/>
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,<br/>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br/>
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,<br/>
At some hours in the night spirits resort—<br/>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br/>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br/>
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,<br/>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.<br/>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br/>
Environed with all these hideous fears,<br/>
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?<br/>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?<br/>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,<br/>
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?<br/>
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost<br/>
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body<br/>
Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!<br/>
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.

O woeful day, O woeful day.

<p class="drama">
PARIS.<br/>
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.<br/>
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,<br/>
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.<br/>
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.<br/>
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now<br/>
To murder, murder our solemnity?<br/>
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,<br/>
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,<br/>
And with my child my joys are buried.

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not<br/>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br/>
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,<br/>
And all the better is it for the maid.<br/>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br/>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br/>
The most you sought was her promotion,<br/>
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,<br/>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d<br/>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br/>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill<br/>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.<br/>
She’s not well married that lives married long,<br/>
But she’s best married that dies married young.<br/>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br/>
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,<br/>
And in her best array bear her to church;<br/>
For though fond nature bids us all lament,<br/>
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAPULET.<br/>
All things that we ordained festival<br/>
Turn from their office to black funeral:<br/>
Our instruments to melancholy bells,<br/>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;<br/>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;<br/>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<br/>
And all things change them to the contrary.
</p>

<p class="drama">
FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br/>
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,<br/>
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare<br/>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.<br/>
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;<br/>
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is
