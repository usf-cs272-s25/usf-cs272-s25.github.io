<h2><a name="chap07"></a>INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW</h2>

<p>
It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield,
that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in
front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least.
We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde.”
</p>

<p>
“I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once
saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?”
</p>

<p>
“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned
Enfield. “And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to
know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own
fault that I found it out, even when I did.”
</p>

<p>
“So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that
be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you
the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the
presence of a friend might do him good.”
</p>

<p>
The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight,
although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle
one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking
the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner,
Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.
</p>

<p>
“What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.”
</p>

<p>
“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very
low. It will not last long, thank God.”
</p>

<p>
“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be
out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my
cousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a
quick turn with us.”
</p>

<p>
“You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very
much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson,
I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and
Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.”
</p>

<p>
“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing
we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.”
</p>

<p>
“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the
doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was
struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and
despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but
for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had
been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word. In silence,
too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a
neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some
stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his
companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in
silence.
