<h3>
CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328
</h3>

<p>
It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who have
considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them, who
have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in their
day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and obscurity; or have
been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way. They have either been
exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage
that in shame they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some
other deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have
been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales would
not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they are omitted. I
believe that these lowly beginnings of great men occur because Fortune is
desirous of showing to the world that such men owe much to her and little
to wisdom, because she begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take
no part in their career: thus all success must be attributed to her.
Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds,
if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he
was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor
distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history will show. It
appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in
him such indications of valour and fortune as should make him a great
exemplar to men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his
actions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.
</p>

<p>
The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families of
Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in estate,
as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a son Antonio,
who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca, and for this
reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He had an only
sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying
she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again went to live with her
brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided,
and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could have
access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after sunrise,
Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was called, had occasion
to go into the vineyard as usual to gather herbs for seasoning the dinner,
and hearing a slight rustling among the leaves of a vine she turned her
eyes in that direction, and heard something resembling the cry of an
infant. Whereupon she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a
baby who was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying for
its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full of compassion,
she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where she washed it and
clothed it with clean linen as is customary, and showed it to Messer
Antonio when he returned home. When he heard what had happened and saw the
child he was not less surprised or compassionate than his sister. They
discussed between themselves what should be done, and seeing that he was
priest and that she had no children, they finally determined to bring it
up. They had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were
their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio
after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and
gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond
his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer
Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted
him into his canonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was
given with this object; but Antonio discovered that the character of
Castruccio was quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio
reached the age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of
Messer Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off
reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting
in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running, leaping, and
wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far excelled his companions
in courage and bodily strength, and if at any time he did turn to books,
only those pleased him which told of wars and the mighty deeds of men.
Messer Antonio beheld all this with vexation and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family, named
Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches, bodily
strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had often fought
under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a Ghibelline was the
valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman resided in Lucca and
was accustomed to assemble with others most mornings and evenings under
the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San
Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio
taking part with other children of the street in those games of which I
have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other boys, and
that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over them, and that they
loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became greatly desirous of learning
who he was. Being informed of the circumstances of the bringing up of
Castruccio he felt a greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he
called him one day and asked him whether he would more willingly live in
the house of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use
arms, or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses
and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased
Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he stood
silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer Francesco to
speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable, nothing would
please him more than to give up his priestly studies and take up those of
a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time
he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield by his
knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he would not be able
to hold him much longer.
</p>

<p>
Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to the
house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was astonishing to
find that in a very short time he manifested all that virtue and bearing
which we are accustomed to associate with a true gentleman. In the first
place he became an accomplished horseman, and could manage with ease the
most fiery charger, and in all jousts and tournaments, although still a
youth, he was observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises
of strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of these
accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled him to avoid
offence in either act or word to others, for he was deferential to the
great men, modest with his equals, and courteous to his inferiors. These
gifts made him beloved, not only by all the Guinigi family, but by all
Lucca. When Castruccio had reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines
were driven from Pavia by the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by
the Visconti to assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in
charge of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and
courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other
captain, and his name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but
throughout all Lombardy.
</p>

<p>
Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he left
it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many friends
as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary for that
purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen
years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to be his son’s
tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died Francesco called
Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he
(Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to the son the
gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon the
death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor of Pagolo,
which increased enormously his power and position, and created a certain
amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the former universal
goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring tyrannical intentions.
Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the
Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become
the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the
great abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of
governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began to sow those
seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence. Castruccio at first
treated this with scorn, but afterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that
Messer Giorgio might be able to bring him into disgrace with the deputy of
King Ruberto of Naples and have him driven out of Lucca.
</p>

<p>
The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,
who being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became their
lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom
Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting their
restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his
plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi.
Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified
the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions of war, in
order that it might stand a siege for a few days in case of need. When the
night came which had been agreed upon with Uguccione, who had occupied the
plain between the mountains and Pisa with many men, the signal was given,
and without being observed Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and
set fire to the portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the
city, calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side.
Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer
Giorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The
governor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the
wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found
that more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those who
fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the
headquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most
hostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.
</p>

<p>
As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party that
the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they determined to
restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a large army in the
Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence they marched to
Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into Lucca. Upon this
Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and with a number of
German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the
quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew
from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia.
Uguccione now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two
miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of both
parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of Uguccione, the
Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione,
finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left
the command of the army in the hands of Castruccio. This change brought
about the ruin of the Guelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having
lost its captain had lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio
observed this, and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this
belief; he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the
munitions of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more
insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they
drew out in the order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio.
Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having
mastered their tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he
spoke a few words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to
them the certainty of victory if they would but obey his commands.
Castruccio had noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the
centre of the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of
the army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant
men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he
moved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his
lines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had
come in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre
squadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the
wings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of
the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out
of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated
from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each other. By
this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s men were opposed to
the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and the most efficient men of the
enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines were unable to fight with
those who were arrayed opposite to them, or to give any assistance to
their own flanks. So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to
flight on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when they
found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance of displaying
their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss in men very heavy,
there being more than ten thousand men killed with many officers and
knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany, and also many princes who had come
to help them, among whom were Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and
Carlo, his nephew, and Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of
Castruccio the loss did not amount to more than three hundred men, among
whom was Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was
killed in the first onset.
</p>

<p>
This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that
Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it
appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of
power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only waited
for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the death of
Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in Lucca, the
murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge. On the
sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were driven
off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming to the
knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper
opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who
was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio
prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing no evil,
went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained at supper, and
then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put him to death lest the
people should be incensed, kept him alive, in order to hear further from
his father concerning his intentions. Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and
cowardice of his son, and at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four
hundred horsemen to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet
reached the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and
created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached
Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to
him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them
should close their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of
what had happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to
demand the liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had
arrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private circles,
afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult,
and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that
Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might
happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered his
friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked Uguccione;
who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away with his friends
to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in poverty.
</p>

<p>
But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca, and
he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people that they
appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having obtained this,
and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the recovery of the many
towns which had rebelled after the departure of Uguccione, and with the
help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to
Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed a fort against it, which
is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio
captured the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly
seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun the
whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads from Lombardy
to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested it from the hands of
Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the lord of it. After this victory he
returned to Lucca, and was welcomed by the whole people. And now
Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any longer to defer making himself a
prince, got himself created the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del
Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi,
all of whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and
deliberately elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of
Bavaria, the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial
crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met
him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his
deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because
of the people’s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received
in great honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,
and he was appointed the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the
Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven
out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick. Frederick
created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread of the
Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were constrained to
accept him as their lord.
</p>

<p>
Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian
affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,
who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for help and
counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his country, if enabled
to recover it with his assistance. Among these exiles were Matteo Guidi,
Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all
exiled Florentines and Ghibellines. Castruccio had the secret intention of
becoming the master of all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own
forces; and in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a
league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for
him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five
gates, he divided his own country districts into five parts, which he
supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so
that he could quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers,
without those whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he
surrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer
Matteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven
out the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King
Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines in
their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they should be
compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to defend
themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized Fucecchio and San
Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country. Whereupon the
Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely reached Tuscany, when
Castruccio was forced by other necessities to return to Lucca.
</p>

<p>
There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so powerful
that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance him to the
dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not received such
rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited other families
to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They found their
opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set upon the
lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and killed him. They
endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a
peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and
compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to
be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired.
Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence than they
had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news of what had happened
at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command of the army, and with a
troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary to his expectations, he found
the rebellion at an end, yet he posted his men in the most advantageous
places throughout the city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio
ought to be very much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without
saying anything on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for
doing so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family
by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations
which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio graciously
responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave
him more pleasure to find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him
anxiety to hear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his
family to him, saying that he thanked God for having given him the
opportunity of showing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of
Stefano and Castruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately
thrown into prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had
recovered San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make
peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at
Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a
truce, which they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and
desirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded with
them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the conquests
they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble, turned his
attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be
subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various
pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition
might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving
them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands of life
also, stating that he had found by experience that none of them were to be
trusted. Then for his further security he raised a fortress in Lucca with
the stones of the towers of those whom he had killed or hunted out of the
state.
</p>

<p>
Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his
position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of
increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he could
get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence, which was
his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends with the
mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both parties confided
their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the
Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di
Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret
communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the other out of
the city; and, after many threatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo
fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese
side of the city; both trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines,
because they believed that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to
fight than the Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He
gave promises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person,
and to Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the
appointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself
direct to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and both
were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a signal
given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other Bastiano di
Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans of either
faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the hands of
Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the palace, compelled
the people to yield obedience to him, making them many promises and
remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to the city to see the
new prince, and all were filled with hope and quickly settled down,
influenced in a great measure by his great valour.
</p>

<p>
About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness of
living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon. The
German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened—murders
and tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put an
end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should call
in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of the
city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could
apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to
give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio
considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor this
service, because he believed that he himself would not be safe if at any
time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo Guinigi in command at
Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six hundred horsemen, where he was
received by Enrico with the greatest distinction. In a short time the
presence of Castruccio obtained such respect for the emperor that, without
bloodshed or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of
Castruccio having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities
of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had chastised
some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary obedience was
rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman
senator. This dignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being
clothed in a brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on
its front: “I am what God wills.” Whilst on the back was: “What God
desires shall be.”
</p>

<p>
During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio
should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could
tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be difficult
in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were Baldo Cecchi
and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face danger. These
men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid
of the Florentines entered the city by night, and after driving out some
of Castruccio’s officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored
the city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio, and
taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia. When the
Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would lose no time, they
decided to intercept him with their forces in the Val di Nievole, under
the belief that by doing so they would cut off his road to Pistoia.
Assembling a great army of the supporters of the Guelph cause, the
Florentines entered the Pistoian territories. On the other hand,
Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his army; and having heard where the
Florentines’ lay, he decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia,
nor to await it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could,
to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that if he
succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although he was informed
that the Florentines had thirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve
thousand. Although he had every confidence in his own abilities and the
valour of his troops, yet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open
lest he should be overwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between
Pescia and Pistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole,
not in the exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in
places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still
narrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that twenty
men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was Manfred, a
German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to
remain in possession of the castle, it being common to the Lucchese and
the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to
displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came
under obligations to no one. For these reasons, and also because the
castle was well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his
position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his
enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no
fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before they became
engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble with Florence
arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which possession of this
castle would give him, and having an intimate friendship with a resident
in the castle, he managed matters so with him that four hundred of his men
were to be admitted into the castle the night before the attack on the
Florentines, and the castellan put to death.
</p>

<p>
Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the
Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away from
Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his army from
Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they reached their
encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill on the following
morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the castle at night, had
also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching from thence at midnight
in dead silence, had reached the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the
Florentines commenced the ascent of the hill at the same time in the
morning. Castruccio sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a
troop of four hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle.
The Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army
which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession of
the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle. Thus it
happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely
taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so
close were they upon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors.
It was a case of unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were
assailed with such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,
although some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting
reached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The
cavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable
to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness of
the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to be done or
what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were engaged with the
enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed without having made any
effective defence because of their unfortunate position, although in sheer
desperation they had offered a stout resistance. Retreat had been
impossible, with the mountains on both flanks, whilst in front were their
enemies, and in the rear their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men
were unable to strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight,
he sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join
the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched there, and
commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These
orders they carried out with such fury that the Florentines could not
sustain the attack, but gave way, and were soon in full retreat—conquered
more by their unfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy.
Those in the rear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains,
each man seeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very
sanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini
dei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine
noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the Florentine
side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the Guelphs. Immediately
the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out the friends of the
Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not content with occupying
Prato and all the castles on the plains on both sides of the Arno, but
marched his army into the plain of Peretola, about two miles from
Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating
his victory with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for
men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat of the
Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens of Florence,
who were to open the city gates at night; but the conspiracy was
discovered, and the participators in it taken and beheaded, among whom
were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the
Florentines great anxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty,
they sent envoys to King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of
their city; and he, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of
the Guelph cause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines
to receive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and
he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the
pressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled to leave his
positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a
conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi, one
of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland should
be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this conspiracy,
intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of Castruccio, and
drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is
essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and
in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered a
person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal cannot be
passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi and Giovanni Guidi,
two Florentine exiles who were suffering their banishment in Pisa.
Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put him to death, and beheaded
many other noble citizens, and drove their families into exile. It now
appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly
disaffected; he employed much thought and energy upon securing his
position there, and this gave the Florentines their opportunity to
reorganize their army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the
King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time, and
assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry and ten
thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph there was
in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack Pistoia or Pisa first,
and decided that it would be better to march on the latter—a course,
owing to the recent conspiracy, more likely to succeed, and of more
advantage to them, because they believed that the surrender of Pistoia
would follow the acquisition of Pisa.
</p>

<p>
In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army and
quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from thence
on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army which the
Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree alarmed,
believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would deliver the
empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to think that his
enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects of success, than
at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four
thousand horsemen, and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent
Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a
stronger position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its
situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight elevation
above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could not hinder its
being victualled unless they divided their forces, nor could they approach
it either from the direction of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through
to Pisa, or attack Castruccio’s forces except at a disadvantage. In one
case they would find themselves placed between his two armies, the one
under his own command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case
they would have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,
an undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to take
this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of the
river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide expanse
of land between them and the river.
</p>

<p>
The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to
decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,
having weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the
latter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet the
water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the saddles of
the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced
the battle by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand
infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew
what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand infantry
and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue from the river
before he charged them; he also sent one thousand light infantry up the
river bank, and the same number down the Arno. The infantry of the
Florentines were so much impeded by their arms and the water that they
were not able to mount the banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made
the passage of the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the
few who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this being
deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their riders and many
of them had stuck so fast that they could not move. When the Florentine
captains saw the difficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them
and moved higher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less
treacherous and the banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at
the bank by the forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who,
being light armed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with
tremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,
alarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled
each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio and
those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and terrible; both
sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither would yield. The
soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back into the river,
whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land in order to make
room for the others pressing forward, who if they could but get out of the
water would be able to fight, and in this obstinate conflict they were
urged on by their captains. Castruccio shouted to his men that these were
the same enemies whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the
Florentines reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the
few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that
both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had
many killed and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take
up a position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded
these latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and one
part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This cleared a
space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained
possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers
found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s reserves they could
not stand against them and at once fell back into the river. The cavalry
of either side had not as yet gained any decisive advantage over the
other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority in this arm, had
commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive against the attacks
of their adversaries, as he hoped that when he had overcome the infantry
he would be able to make short work of the cavalry. This fell out as he
had hoped, for when he saw the Florentine army driven back across the
river he ordered the remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of
the enemy. This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own
cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to
flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry
had met with in crossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry
cross lower down the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio’s
army. But here, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of
Castruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were
so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them
escaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were
taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo
Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners, fled to
Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely greater, as
might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines there fell twenty
thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst Castruccio lost one
thousand five hundred and seventy men.
</p>

<p>
But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his life
just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus ruined all
those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry into effect,
and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but death could have
stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle the whole of the
day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued and overheated, he
stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from
victory and personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any
attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of the
opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first man in the
saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood exposed to a wind
which often rises at midday on the banks of the Arno, and which is often
very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of which he thought nothing, as
he was accustomed to such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On
the following night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so
rapidly that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore,
called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:
</p>

<p>
“If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the midst
of the career which was leading to that glory which all my successes
promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left thee, if a
smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils, because I should
have been content with the governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should
neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with
so many injuries. But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and
I should have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left
you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established
on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the
arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient judgment to
recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount it. Thou hast
heard, for many have told thee, and I have never concealed it, how I
entered the house of thy father whilst yet a boy—a stranger to all
those ambitions which every generous soul should feel—and how I was
brought up by him, and loved as though I had been born of his blood; how
under his governance I learned to be valiant and capable of availing
myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been witness. When thy good
father came to die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care,
and I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate with
that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou shouldst not
only possess the estate which thy father left, but also that which my
fortune and abilities have gained, I have never married, so that the love
of children should never deflect my mind from that gratitude which I owed
to the children of thy father. Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I
am well content, but I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee
unsettled and insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which
will never rest contented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa,
where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they
may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve
under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up
with factions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the
wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended
Florentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly destroyed,
who will hail the news of my death with more delight than they would the
acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan
thou canst place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their
help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything but
in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and in the
prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which, as thou
knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee to come to terms
with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering under this great defeat,
should be inclined to listen to thee. And whereas I have sought to make
them my enemies, because I believed that war with them would conduce to my
power and glory, thou hast every inducement to make friends of them,
because their alliance will bring thee advantages and security. It is of
the greatest important in this world that a man should know himself, and
the measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he has
not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace.
And it will be well for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to
learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and
in this thou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that
what I have told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in
that I have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.”
</p>

<p>
After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia, and
Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending Pagolo
to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his successor, he died.
He left a happy memory to those who had known him, and no prince of those
times was ever loved with such devotion as he was. His obsequies were
celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he was buried in San Francesco
at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to
Castruccio, for he had not the abilities. Not long after the death of
Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty
held on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi
until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.
</p>

<p>
From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a man
of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time, but
also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the ordinary
height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious presence, and he
welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke with him rarely left
him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short
above the ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without a
hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies; just to
his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful, and willing to
overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue, because he was wont to
say that it was the victory that brought the glory, not the methods of
achieving it. No one was bolder in facing danger, none more prudent in
extricating himself. He was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt
everything and fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because
one always sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also
wonderfully sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did
not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was
not angered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that
he has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on the
following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a partridge,
and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had
said: “You would not have given more than a penny.” “That is true,”
answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: “A ducat is much less to
me.” Having about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he
scorned him, the flatterer said to him: “Fisherman are willing to let the
waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take a few little
fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle that I may catch a
whale”; and this was not only heard by Castruccio with patience but
rewarded. When told by a priest that it was wicked for him to live so
sumptuously, Castruccio said: “If that be a vice then you should not fare
so splendidly at the feasts of our saints.” Passing through a street he
saw a young man as he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen
by Castruccio, and said to him: “Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou
comest out, but when thou goest into such places.” A friend gave him a
very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: “Fool, do you think that I
wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble to fasten.” Castruccio
said to one who professed to be a philosopher: “You are like the dogs who
always run after those who will give them the best to eat,” and was
answered: “We are rather like the doctors who go to the houses of those
who have the greatest need of them.” Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn,
Castruccio was much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was
reproached for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did
not fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that,
since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one
what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: “When thou goest to a
banquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon another.”
To a person who was boasting that he had read many things, Castruccio
said: “He knows better than to boast of remembering many things.” Someone
bragged that he could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio
replied: “An ox does the same.” Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with
whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who told him
that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman, he said: “She
has not taken me in, I have taken her.” Being also blamed for eating very
dainty foods, he answered: “Thou dost not spend as much as I do?” and
being told that it was true, he continued: “Then thou art more avaricious
than I am gluttonous.” Being invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and
splendid citizen of Luca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by
Taddeo into a chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones
representing flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring.
Castruccio gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo,
and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: “I knew not where to
spit in order to offend thee less.” Being asked how Caesar died he said:
“God willing I will die as he did.” Being one night in the house of one of
his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of
his friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was usual
in one of his station, so he said: “He who is considered wise by day will
not be considered a fool at night.” A person came to demand a favour of
Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on
his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio, said:
“Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy ears in thy
feet,” whereupon he obtained double the favour he had asked. Castruccio
used to say that the way to hell was an easy one, seeing that it was in a
downward direction and you travelled blindfolded. Being asked a favour by
one who used many superfluous words, he said to him: “When you have
another request to make, send someone else to make it.” Having been
wearied by a similar man with a long oration who wound up by saying:
“Perhaps I have fatigued you by speaking so long,” Castruccio said: “You
have not, because I have not listened to a word you said.” He used to say
of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards became a fine
man, that he was dangerous, because he first took the husbands from the
wives and now he took the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who
laughed, he said: “Do you laugh because you are successful or because
another is unfortunate?” Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer
Francesco Guinigi, one of his companions said to him: “What shall I give
you if you will let me give you a blow on the nose?” Castruccio answered:
“A helmet.” Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been
instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done
wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived
themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly
those men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying that
they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused when
the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise that whilst
men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it
were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at
her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when he
died, and answered: “With the face turned downwards, for I know when I am
gone this country will be turned upside down.” On being asked if it had
ever occurred to him to become a friar in order to save his soul, he
answered that it had not, because it appeared strange to him that Fra
Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the
Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat to preserve his health,
and replied: “If the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be
poor, then when he can.” Seeing one of his gentlemen make a member of his
family lace him up, he said to him: “I pray God that you will let him feed
you also.” Seeing that someone had written upon his house in Latin the
words: “May God preserve this house from the wicked,” he said, “The owner
must never go in.” Passing through one of the streets he saw a small house
with a very large door, and remarked: “That house will fly through the
door.” He was having a discussion with the ambassador of the King of
Naples concerning the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute
arose between them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the
king. “Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?” asked Castruccio,
and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, “Why should you
suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?”
</p>

<p>
I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and weighty,
but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his high
qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a prince. And
as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune, so he also
desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune; therefore the
manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be seen to this day
fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they were placed by him to
testify forever to his days of adversity. As in his life he was inferior
neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of
Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and he would
doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed that he should be
born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.
