<h2><a name="chap27"></a>DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE
VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR
PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI
</h2>

<p class="center">
BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI
</p>

<p>
The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to clear
himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been raised
against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of Arezzo and
other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola, whence he
intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against Giovanni
Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring that city
under his domination, and to make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.
</p>

<p>
These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and their
following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too powerful,
and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek to destroy
them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon this a meeting
was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to which came the
cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli,
Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and
Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena.
Here were discussed the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of
curbing his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest of
being ruined. And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to
strive to win over the Florentines; and they sent their men to one place
and another, promising to one party assistance and to another
encouragement to unite with them against the common enemy. This meeting
was at once reported throughout all Italy, and those who were discontented
under the duke, among whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of
effecting a revolution.
</p>

<p>
Thus it arose that, men’s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by
certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held for
the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The castellan
was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there; so the
conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being carried to
the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn
up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge
and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being effected, the whole
state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged in this, not so
much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet at Magione, from whom they
expected to get assistance.
</p>

<p>
Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose the
opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any town,
should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and they sent
again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in destroying the
common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and that they ought
not to wait for another opportunity.
</p>

<p>
But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli and
Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo Machiavelli,
their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the duke against his
enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola, because, against
everybody’s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone over to the enemy
and he found himself disarmed and war at his door. But recovering courage
from the offers of the Florentines, he decided to temporize before
fighting with the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for
a reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter he obtained in
two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting
men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort: to all he
gave money.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached
Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the aid
of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the duke
resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with offers of
reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did not fail in any
practices to make the insurgents understand that he wished every man who
had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the
title of prince, whilst others might have the principality.
</p>

<p>
And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to him
to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a
standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every
care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such
preparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in
separate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there came
also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found himself
sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open war, he
considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to outwit them,
and for this reason he did not stop the work of reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in
which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand
ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed an
alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come
personally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the other
hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and other places
seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war
against or ally themselves with any one without his permission.
</p>

<p>
This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,
again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his
state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the
fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by the
enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends. But
the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed his
men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of November
together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he
stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini,
who had assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the
enterprise in which they should now take part; but nothing being
concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished
to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if he did not
wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this the duke replied that
he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany, and thus become hostile to
the Florentines, but that he was very willing to proceed against
Sinigalia.
</p>

<p>
It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the
fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give it
up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to come
there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being invited by
them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no suspicions. And
the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were
with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons. di
Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena about the middle of December,
and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and cleverness he persuaded
the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him at Sinigalia, pointing out to them
that any lack of compliance would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and
permanency of the reconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make
use of the arms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very
stubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not
offend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by
Pagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he
agreed to wait.
</p>

<p>
Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on
30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most trusted
followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor d’Euna, who was
afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo
Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers
in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain
pairs, who should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should
they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke’s quarters, where
they should be seized.
</p>

<p>
The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which there
were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to assemble
by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from Fano, and
await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day of December
at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two
hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he
accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.
</p>

<p>
Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of the
Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who goes
towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases of which
are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia is distant
from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the
shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs a little river
which bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the high
road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good space by road
along the mountains, and reaches the river which passes by Sinigalia. If
he turns to his left hand along the bank of it, and goes for the distance
of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge which crosses the river; he is then
almost abreast of the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight
line, but transversely. Before this gate there stands a collection of
houses with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.
</p>

<p>
The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and to
honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant from
Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men of the
duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band, which
consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who
were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters having been thus
arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of
the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having opened
it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other towards the
country, and a way was left in the middle through which the infantry
passed, without stopping, into the town.
</p>

<p>
Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a few
horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a cape
lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his
approaching death—a circumstance which, in view of the ability of
the man and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that
when he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet the
duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He recommended his
house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his nephews that it
was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that
should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before the duke and
saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill; they
were at once placed between those who were commissioned to look after
them.
</p>

<p>
But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band in
Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting in the square
before his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and drilling
them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care of
Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that
Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined
Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their
quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he
advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to
meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before the
duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto, having made his
obeisance, joined the others.
</p>

<p>
So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s quarters,
and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made them
prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that the men of
Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms. Those of
Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of the Orsini
and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment of the
destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves, and bearing
in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses,
they stood together against the hostile forces of the country and saved
themselves.
</p>

<p>
But the duke’s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men of
Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not repressed
this outrage by killing some of them they would have completely sacked it.
Night having come and the tumult being silenced, the duke prepared to kill
Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a room and caused them to be
strangled. Neither of them used words in keeping with their past lives:
Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins;
Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against the duke on
Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until
the duke heard from Rome that the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the
Archbishop of Florence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which
news, on 18th January 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were
strangled in the same way.
