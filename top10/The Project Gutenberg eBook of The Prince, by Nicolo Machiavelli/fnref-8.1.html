<h2><a name="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS
</h2>

<p>
Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of
which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest
to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more
copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are when, either
by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the principality, or when
by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private person becomes the prince
of his country. And speaking of the first method, it will be illustrated
by two examples—one ancient, the other modern—and without
entering further into the subject, I consider these two examples will
suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.
</p>

<p>
Agathocles, the Sicilian,<a href="#fn-8.1" name="fnref-8.1" id="fnref-8.1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject
position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his
fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies
with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the
military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being
established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself
prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that which had
been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding for this purpose
with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One
morning he assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse, as if he had to
discuss with them things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the
soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, he
seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And
although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet
not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its
defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time raised the
siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were
compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and, leaving Sicily to him, had to
be content with the possession of Africa.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-8.1" id="fn-8.1"></a> <a href="#fnref-8.1">[1]</a>
Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will
see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as he
attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any one,
but step by step in the military profession, which steps were gained with
a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly held by him
with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay
fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy,
without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if
the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from
dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and
overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less
than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and
inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated
among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be attributed either
to fortune or genius.
</p>

<p>
In our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da Fermo,
having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by his
maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his youth sent
to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his discipline,
he might attain some high position in the military profession. After
Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo, and in a very short
time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind, he became the
first man in his profession. But it appearing a paltry thing to serve
under others, he resolved, with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom
the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty, and with the
help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani
that, having been away from home for many years, he wished to visit him
and his city, and in some measure to look upon his patrimony; and although
he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that
the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to
come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his
friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should
be received honourably by the Fermians, all of which would be not only to
his honour, but also to that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.
</p>

<p>
Giovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew, and
he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he lodged him
in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having arranged what
was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to
which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of Fermo. When the
viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets
were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses,
speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of
their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he
rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more
private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and
the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they seated
than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered Giovanni and the
rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on horseback, rode up and
down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace, so that in
fear the people were forced to obey him, and to form a government, of
which he made himself the prince. He killed all the malcontents who were
able to injure him, and strengthened himself with new civil and military
ordinances, in such a way that, in the year during which he held the
principality, not only was he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had
become formidable to all his neighbours. And his destruction would have
been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to
be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli
at Sinigalia, as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed
this parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had
made his leader in valour and wickedness.
</p>

<p>
Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite
treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and
defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own
citizens; seeing that many others, by means of cruelty, have never been able
even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of
war. I believe that this follows from severities<a href="#fn-8.2" name="fnref-8.2" id="fnref-8.2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it
is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to
one’s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can
be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are those which,
notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather
than decrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God or
man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is impossible
for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-8.2" id="fn-8.2"></a> <a href="#fnref-8.2">[2]</a>
Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern equivalent of
Machiavelli’s thought when he speaks of “crudelta” than the
more obvious “cruelties.”
</p>

<p>
Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to
examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to
inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them
daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them,
and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from
timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his
hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves
to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought
to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less;
benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them
may last longer.
</p>

<p>
And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a
way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall make
him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you
are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help you, for they
will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be under any
obligation to you for them.
