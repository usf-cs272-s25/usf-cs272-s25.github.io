<h2><a name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br/>
CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE’S OWN
</h2>

<p>
Auxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a prince is
called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by Pope Julius in the
most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise against Ferrara, had poor
proof of his mercenaries, turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand,
King of Spain,<a href="#fn-13.1" name="fnref-13.1" id="fnref-13.1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
for his assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in
themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always disadvantageous; for
losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their captive.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-13.1" id="fn-13.1"></a> <a href="#fnref-13.1">[1]</a>
Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples), surnamed “The
Catholic,” born 1452, died 1516.
</p>

<p>
And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish to
leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which cannot
fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw himself
entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune brought
about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his rash choice;
because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the Switzers having
risen and driven out the conquerors (against all expectation, both his and
others), it so came to pass that he did not become prisoner to his
enemies, they having fled, nor to his auxiliaries, he having conquered by
other arms than theirs.
</p>

<p>
The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand Frenchmen
to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other time of their
troubles.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor of Constantinople,<a href="#fn-13.2" name="fnref-13.2" id="fnref-13.2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
to oppose his neighbours, sent ten thousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war
being finished, were not willing to quit; this was the beginning of the
servitude of Greece to the infidels.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-13.2" id="fn-13.2"></a> <a href="#fnref-13.2">[2]</a>
Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,
for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them the
ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to others;
but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and better
opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one community,
they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you have made
their head, is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure
you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most dangerous; in
auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these
arms and turned to his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them
than to conquer with the others, not deeming that a real victory which is
gained with the arms of others.
</p>

<p>
I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke
entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers,
and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not
appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less
danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on
handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he
destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one and
the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the
difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the
French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own
soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever
increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that
he was complete master of his own forces.
</p>

<p>
I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am
unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I have
named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by the
Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted like our
Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him that he could
neither keep them nor let them go, he had them all cut to pieces, and
afterwards made war with his own forces and not with aliens.
</p>

<p>
I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament
applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with
Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed him
with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them on his
back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to meet the
enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of others
either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.
</p>

<p>
Charles the Seventh,<a href="#fn-13.3" name="fnref-13.3" id="fnref-13.3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
the father of King Louis the Eleventh,<a href="#fn-13.4" name="fnref-13.4" id="fnref-13.4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
having by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English, recognized
the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his
kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. Afterwards his son,
King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the Switzers, which
mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a source of peril to that
kingdom; because, having raised the reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely
diminished the value of his own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry
altogether; and his men-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as
they are so accustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that
they can now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand
against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off well
against others. The armies of the French have thus become mixed, partly
mercenary and partly national, both of which arms together are much better than
mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone, but much inferior to one’s own
forces. And this example proves it, for the kingdom of France would be
unconquerable if the ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained.
</p>

Charles VII of France, surnamed “The Victorious,” born 1403, died
1461.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p>
But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks well at
first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I have said above of
hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils
until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to
few. And if the first disaster to the Roman Empire<a href="#fn-13.5" name="fnref-13.5" id="fnref-13.5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
should be examined, it will be found to have commenced only with the enlisting
of the Goths; because from that time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to
decline, and all that valour which had raised it passed away to others.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-13.5" id="fn-13.5"></a> <a href="#fnref-13.5">[5]</a>
“Many speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the
reduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of the
conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence. When Mr
Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank under the weight
of its military obligations, he said that this was ‘wholly
unhistorical.’ He might well have added that the Roman power was at its
zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to fight for the State,
but that it began to decline as soon as this obligation was no longer
recognised.”—<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, 15th May 1906.
</p>

<p>
I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its
own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not
having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And it has always
been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain
or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength. And one’s
own forces are those which are composed either of subjects, citizens, or
dependents; all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries. And the way to make
ready one’s own forces will be easily found if the rules suggested by me
shall be reflected upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father
of Alexander the Great, and many republics and princes have armed and
organized themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.
