<h2><a name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/>
HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES
</h2>

<p>
Having discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such
principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having
considered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and
having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and to
hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of offence
and defence which belong to each of them.
</p>

<p>
We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his
foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to
ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or
composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good laws
where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well
armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the discussion
and shall speak of the arms.
</p>

<p>
I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are
either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and
auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on
these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited,
ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly
before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and
destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is
robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other
attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is
not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be
your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves
off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the
ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for
many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and
appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed
what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize
Italy with chalk in hand;<a href="#fn-12.1" name="fnref-12.1" id="fnref-12.1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they
were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were
the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a name="fn-12.1" id="fn-12.1"></a> <a href="#fnref-12.1">[1]</a>
“With chalk in hand,” “col gesso.” This is one of the
<i>bons mots</i> of Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles
VIII seized Italy, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his
quartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the country.
<i>Cf</i>. “The History of Henry VII,” by Lord Bacon: “King
Charles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a kind of a
felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy without resistance: so
that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont to say: That the Frenchmen came
into Italy with chalk in their hands, to mark up their lodgings, rather than
with swords to fight.”
</p>

<p>
I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The mercenary
captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot
trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by
oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your
intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual
way.
</p>

<p>
And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, whether
mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by
a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform
the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its citizens, and when one
is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and
when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so that he does not leave the
command. And experience has shown princes and republics, single-handed,
making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing nothing except damage;
and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms,
under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with
foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The
Switzers are completely armed and quite free.
</p>

<p>
Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who were
oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the Romans,
although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains. After the
death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers
by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their liberty.
</p>

<p>
Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against the
Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,<a href="#fn-12.2" name="fnref-12.2" id="fnref-12.2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His father,
Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna<a href="#fn-12.3" name="fnref-12.3" id="fnref-12.3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
of Naples, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into
the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the
Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these arms, and
yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have defended them, I
reply that the Florentines in this case have been favoured by chance, for of
the able captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not
conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their ambitions
elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,<a href="#fn-12.4" name="fnref-12.4" id="fnref-12.4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but every one will
acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines would have stood at his
discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each
other. Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church
and the kingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while
ago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most prudent
man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. If this man
had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the
Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the soldier of their enemies
they had no means of resisting, and if they held to him they must obey him. The
Venetians, if their achievements are considered, will be seen to have acted
safely and gloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with
armed gentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to
enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook this
virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the beginning of their
expansion on land, through not having much territory, and because of their
great reputation, they had not much to fear from their captains; but when they
expanded, as under Carmignuola,<a href="#fn-12.5" name="fnref-12.5" id="fnref-12.5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant man
(they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the other hand,
knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they would no longer
conquer under him, and for this reason they were not willing, nor were they
able, to let him go; and so, not to lose again that which they had acquired,
they were compelled, in order to secure themselves, to murder him. They had
afterwards for their captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino,
the count of Pitigliano,<a href="#fn-12.6" name="fnref-12.6" id="fnref-12.6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not gain, as happened
afterwards at Vaila,<a href="#fn-12.7" name="fnref-12.7" id="fnref-12.7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had
acquired with so much trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but
slowly, long delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.

<p>
And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled for
many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously, in order
that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better prepared to
counteract them. You must understand that the empire has recently come to
be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired more temporal power,
and that Italy has been divided up into more states, for the reason that
many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles, who, formerly
favoured by the emperor, were oppressing them, whilst the Church was
favouring them so as to gain authority in temporal power: in many others
their citizens became princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell
partly into the hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church
consisting of priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms,
both commenced to enlist foreigners.
</p>

<p>
The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,<a href="#fn-12.8" name="fnref-12.8" id="fnref-12.8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
the Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others, Braccio and
Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After these came all the
other captains who till now have directed the arms of Italy; and the end of all
their valour has been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis,
ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has
guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that they might
increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on their pay and without
territory, they were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did
not give them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a
moderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs were
brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were
not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used every
art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing
in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not
attack towns at night, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at
night; they did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did
they campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military
rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue and dangers;
thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.
