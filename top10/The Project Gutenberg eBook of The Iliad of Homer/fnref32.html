<h2><a name="pref01"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>
Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism.
To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our
ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character of our
education, we must continually forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge
previously acquired; we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and,
as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no
small labour and anxiety to acquire.
</p>

<p>
And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress
has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons and things
are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of their conventional value.
The same principles which have swept away traditional abuses, and which are
making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin,
tawdry veil from attractive superstitions, are working as actively in
literature as in society. The credulity of one writer, or the partiality of
another, finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the
healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of
conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History
and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected
to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of
former ages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives
of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history,
as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it
is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is
sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In
brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere facts. Human nature,
viewed under an induction of extended experience, is the best help to the
criticism of human history. Historical characters can only be estimated by the
standard which human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished.
To form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a
great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings
by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives
or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider the
general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective probability of its
details.
</p>

<p>
It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and
talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
have, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind
than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all
three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us
little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow. The
personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will
allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to
the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty. Of
Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will
allow us to know. He was one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> in two dramas as
unlike in principles as in style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as
different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When
we have read Plato <i>or</i> Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates;
when we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are
something worse than ignorant.
</p>

<p>
It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the
personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too
much for our belief. This system—which has often comforted the religious
sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those of the New
Testament—has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of
the last and present centuries. To question the existence of Alexander the
Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To
deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory
developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same
way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the
elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<i>Numa Pompilius.</i>
</p>

<p>
Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and the
state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe
any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the
author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the
subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a
circle. “This cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not
true, because it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which
testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and
oblivion.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are partly
forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth is the
requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in
its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life
of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.
</p>

<p>
According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an early
period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece. Among
the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he married,
and the result of the union was a girl named Critheïs. The girl was left an
orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to
the indiscretion of this maiden that we “are indebted for so much
happiness.” Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and
received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles,
in Bœotia, whither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her
reputation.
</p>

<p>
“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at
Smyrna a man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being
married, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he
received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her
performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of
marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her son,
who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully brought
up.”
</p>

<p>
They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had
bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment,
and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him
sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on
his adopted father’s school with great success, exciting the admiration
not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade
carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that
city. Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura,
who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded
Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his travels. He promised
not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend,
urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see
with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the
subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes consented, and set out with his
patron, “examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and
informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met.” We
may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of
preservation.<a href="#fn2" name="fnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Having set sail
from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had
already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes, who was about to
leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his,
named Mentor, the son of Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host,
Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses,
which afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca
assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans
make their city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where
he applied himself to the study of poetry.<a href="#fn3" name="fnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan plain, he
arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ. Here his misfortunes
and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer.
“And up to my time,” continued the author, “the inhabitants
showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses,
and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar grew, which they said
had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived”.<a href="#fn4" name="fnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being the
most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on Gordius,
king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability, been
attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.<a href="#fn5" name="fnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Cumæ, he frequented the <i>converzationes</i><a href="#fn6" name="fnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by
this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public
maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously renowned. They avowed
their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and procured him
an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the purport of which
our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate
respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s demand,
but one man observed that “if they were to feed <i>Homers</i>, they would
be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this
circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of
Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <i>Homers</i>.”<a href="#fn7" name="fnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
With a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in
its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his
disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet capable of
giving it renown and glory.
</p>

<p>
At Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress. One
Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept Homer in his
own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the verses of the poet
passing in his name. Having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable,
Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose
brains he had sucked, and left him. At his departure, Homer is said to have
observed: “O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the knowledge of
man, nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart.”<a href="#fn8" name="fnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian
merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite,
acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable
livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at once determined him
to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but
he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a town of Ionia, which faces that
island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having
embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to
expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had
drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.
</p>

<p>
At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocœa,
by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little
hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will continue in the
words of our author. “Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on,
attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on
his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the name of the
goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them
away from Homer. For some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have
reached such a place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then
went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places
and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him
the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took
him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup.<a href="#fn9" name="fnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to
their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my
friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at the
doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor
wild beast will approach the fold.
</p>

<p>
Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having
finished supper, they banqueted<a href="#fn10" name="fnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
afresh on conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the
cities he had visited.
</p>

<p>
At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus resolved
to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with Homer. Having left
the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to
return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding
his mate, he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid
little attention to what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in
taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring
the stranger to him.
</p>

<p>
Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring him
that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that the
stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the Chian
persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his children.<a href="#fn11" name="fnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island,
Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of Chios he
established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry. “To this
day,” says Chandler,<a href="#fn12" name="fnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
“the most curious remaining is that which has been named, without reason,
the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city,
northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top
of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess,
the head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair
has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low
rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain,
is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity.”
</p>

<p>
So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable fortune. He
married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other married a
Chian.
</p>

<p>
The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of
the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been
mentioned:—
</p>

<p>
“In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his poem as the
companion of Ulysses,<a href="#fn13" name="fnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> in
return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness. He also
testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and
instruction.”
</p>

<p>
His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit
Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is said, made some
additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the Athenians, of
whose city he had hitherto made no mention,<a href="#fn14" name="fnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
he sent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him
in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the
Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and
by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a subsistence,
visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was very popular.
</p>

<p>
In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now Ino,
where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his death arose from
vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some
fishermen’s children.<a href="#fn15" name="fnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess, and
so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is scarcely
necessary to point them out in detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions
to which a persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means
consistent—series of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to
bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.
</p>

<p>
“Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in
doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have done
honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The majestic stream of
his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through many lands and
nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains will ever remain
concealed.”
</p>

<p>
Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has
eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric question
is involved. With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:—
</p>

<p>
“It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region of
twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of genius
always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out
of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of all the historical
testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the
Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the
secret of the poet.”<a href="#fn16" name="fnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human
nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us
pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual?<a href="#fn17" name="fnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of
an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?
</p>

<p>
Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some
deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of
a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are perpetually labouring to
destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the
animals on earth we least know what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is
best for us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than
I do.”<a href="#fn18" name="fnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with
the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without
seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute
analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the
doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to
entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his
imagination, and to condescend to dry details.
</p>

<p>
Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this
unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must express my sympathy
with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:—
</p>

<p>
“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better,
the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original
composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive
integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to assert, that the
minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for
the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole. The
most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame:
and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and
general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.
</p>

<p>
“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of
Pope.—
</p>

<p class="poem">
“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit<br/>
Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,<br/>
How parts relate to parts, or they to whole,<br/>
The body’s harmony, the beaming soul,<br/>
Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,<br/>
When man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”<a href="#fn19" name="fnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity
of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious Thucydides
quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,<a href="#fn20" name="fnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.
Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the
comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,<a href="#fn21" name="fnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names<a href="#fn22" name="fnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>
it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of
Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our
early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which
more modern investigations lay claim.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the
subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel of
songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer,
at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs were not collected
together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus’ time,
about five hundred years after.”<a href="#fn23" name="fnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism
on the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico,
that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf
with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that
we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will
detail in the words of Grote:—<a href="#fn24" name="fnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,
turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently
published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the
Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means the
whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by
Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad
and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and
unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before
Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written
copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times,
to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the
perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived
by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity.
The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably
supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the
points in Wolf’s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and
Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the
one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it
has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate
character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems
from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to
Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise
admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the
question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, we were driven
to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth century before
the Christian æra. Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr.
Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less
than Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh century
before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no remaining
inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are
rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure ourselves whether
Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other
early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at
what time the practice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground
which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in
the famous ordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the
Panathenæa: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we
are unable to say.
</p>

<p>
“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing
habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit generally that the
Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,—but upon the
supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the
preservation of the poems—the unassisted memory of reciters being neither
sufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by
running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with
extraordinary memory,<a href="#fn25" name="fnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> is far
less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially
non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and materials
for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong positive reason
for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by
consulting a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have
been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as
well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind
bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as
the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The author
of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as
attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious that the
memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript
in his chest.”

<p>
The loss of the digamma, that <i>crux</i> of critics, that quicksand upon which
even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt, that
the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable change.
Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have
suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved. If Chaucer’s
poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have come down to us
in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough,
quaint, noble original.
</p>

<p>
“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed
any other Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,
though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solôn. If,
in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate
period, the question at once suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in
that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have been
intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not for the
rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but also
interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those
flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were
required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never
reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive it
with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and
crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable
would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of readers capable of
analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the
crowd, and who would, on perusing the written words, realize in their
imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter.
Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in
all early societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading
class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be
formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems
were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest
probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the
narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before
the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus,
Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this supposition on the
change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and
music—the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as
rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been
transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such
a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest
approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the old epical
treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the
men who stood forward in it, may well be considered as desirous to study, and
competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written
words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed
and eulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems, therefore,
ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important,
but very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old
epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the
Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century
(B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about
the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite
papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless
slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before
the time of Solôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though
still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority,
and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual
rhapsodes.”<a href="#fn26" name="fnref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the
credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
observations—
</p>

<p>
“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw
some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least
over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and
harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets,
who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have
inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus,
Anacreon, and Simonidês were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad
and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize,
that it is almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture
should not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies
which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric
age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys,
to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress
as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may
have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however,
finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and
distinguishing characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the
language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,
should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and
modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such a period to
imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the
character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of
Sir Tristram.
</p>

<p>
“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian
compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of
Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later,
and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than
ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all the traditions
of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most
subordinate and insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their
ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible, indeed,
that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact, that in
the great maritime expedition of western Greece against the rival and
half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain of Thessaly, from his
valour and the number of his forces, may have been the most important ally of
the Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the
Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield
to their taste. The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no
doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid
would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of
compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid. Could France have
given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of the Jerusalem. If,
however, the Homeric ballads, as they are sometimes called, which related the
wrath of Achilles, with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to
the rest of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still
surprising, that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never
betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a
race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring
neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the almost
total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the questionable
dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military
tactics of his age.”<a href="#fn27" name="fnref27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that Wolf’s
objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been
wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten
us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with which the whole
subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his
hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann’s<a href="#fn28" name="fnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
modification of his theory any better. He divides the first twenty-two books of
the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief
that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than
the age of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover,
we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen
poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle
after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Eubœans; Tlepolemus,
of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous
and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make their appearance,
and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that “it seems strange that any
number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the
services of all six in the sequel.” The discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes,
who is represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral
in the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.
</p>

<p>
Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject,
has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian theory, and of
Lachmann’s modifications with the character of Peisistratus. But he has
also shown, and we think with equal success, that the two questions relative to
the primitive unity of these poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison
of these parts by Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially
distinct. In short, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put
together out of pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus
as the period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary
<i>employês</i> of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already
ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic
“recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous
manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of
attention.
</p>

<p>
“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems
themselves confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the
Iliad or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of
Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought
about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the habits of
writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments, the close
military array, the improved construction of ships, the Amphiktyonic
convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious festivals, the Oriental and
Egyptian veins of religion, &amp;c., familiar to the latter epoch. These
alterations Onomakritus, and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could
hardly have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for the first
time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one
large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in substance
and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than
Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those passages which, on the
best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century
before Christ, and may well have been heard by Archilochus and
Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod—as genuine
Homeric matter.<a href="#fn29" name="fnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> As far as the
evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we
seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited
substantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial divergences of
text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian
time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated
fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems,
considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight
into the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the
subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive contrasts
between their former and their later condition.”<a href="#fn30" name="fnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus were
wholly of an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I can lay down
nothing respecting the extent of his labours. At the same time, so far from
believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their
present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine
taste and elegant mind of that Athenian<a href="#fn31" name="fnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,
rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis.
I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were
written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their
reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we
are upon either subject.
</p>

<p>
I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the
preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the
same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must be
measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made by
an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It is as
follows:—
</p>

<p>
“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of
some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent
music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United
States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them. But
what was passing around them? The grand events of a spirit-stirring war;
occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former
times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed
a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient
times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were
merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,
probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory
considerably.
</p>

<p>
“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a
poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most probably the
former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose
of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he
published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now
exists, under the title of the ‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did
not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it,
remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were
found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but
this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging
arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,
arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast
pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers
or compilers would be competent to do so.’
</p>

<p>
“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,
recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized the hint
that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs<a href="#fn32" name="fnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
grew under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem
under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays of the
ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a
chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the poem was destined
to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first, the poems were destined
to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions, by the people who took to singing
them in the streets, assemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then
Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and
restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a
great measure.”<a href="#fn33" name="fnref33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have
developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must still
express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems.
To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them, and that the
intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more
serious than the negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious
assumption, but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would
either understand or enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and
personality of their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, <i>quocunque
nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit</i>, I feel conscious that, while the whole
weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign
these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal
evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of
the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
The minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed,
considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would be
gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance in a philological
view, I am inclined to set little store on its æsthetic value, especially in
poetry. Three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations,
some of which, had they been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or
Africanus, he would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact
in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often least
competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not poets by
profession, but may be so <i>per accidens</i>. I do not at this moment remember
two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a
passage, although a mass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given
us the history of a thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge
would be gloomy and jejune.
</p>

<p>
But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will exercise
their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an heroic or
dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words
and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale,
and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful
affiliation, they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till the
author is reduced to a collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they
possessed the works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a
vile counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of Knight,
Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of the utter
uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects
what another considers the turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed
knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else.
</p>

<p>
Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a
literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to
revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Seneca are
by <i>four</i> different authors.<a href="#fn34" name="fnref34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in
their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like Boethius
and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their freedom
from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent
abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the present day would question
the capabilities of the same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not
only these, but a great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father
Hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid of
Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without
wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and
learning—nay, the refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have
bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern
Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather
than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the literary
history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the
transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their
first creation.
</p>

<p>
I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were of a
purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why corrupt and
imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his day, than that the
poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have given so much trouble to
Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after all, the main fault in all the Homeric
theories is, that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which
poetry most powerfully appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The
ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does
too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with
love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author of the
Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate
analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul;
and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus. There is a
catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of
the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.
</p>

<p>
While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature herself
for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing in Homer as
the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed of the poet, and
even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of
imitators could not exhaust,—still I am far from wishing to deny that the
author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked
mythical storehouse from whence he might derive both subject and embellishment.
But it is one thing to <i>use</i> existing romances in the embellishment of a
poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency
of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what
bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?
</p>

<p>
A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are
features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the most
original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions—nay, even his
own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses
of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading principle—some
invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem
like the Iliad can never come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque,
episodes the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of
gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in
more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to create
a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and embellishments, be
present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers
and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy: we shall have a cento
of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect.
</p>

<p>
Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as I
must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems
to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism
than it has often obtained. We are not by nature intended to know all things;
still less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have
been placed at our disposal. Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder
why God willed our ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the
contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried
touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the
condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory
of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which
would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the
giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.
</p>

<p>
Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to
his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt
appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped in admiration of the
whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover. In
reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time
being, we in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves,
burn with the same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can
but attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice
for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only
the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts
of men by the power of song.
</p>

<p>
And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their
powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who is evidently
little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:—
</p>

<p>
“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has
ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen. Prophets,
lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other nations; it was
reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is a feature in their
character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy.
When lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already
been accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior genius. He held up
before his nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods
and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with
purity and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;
on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which outweighs all
others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth from a breast which
sympathized with all the feelings of man; and therefore they enter, and will
continue to enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is
granted to his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he
dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations from the fields
of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain
which his magic wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast
assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had been
called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may
reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness.”<a href="#fn35" name="fnref35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of
Homer”<a href="#fn36" name="fnref36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> is depictured,
and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals most
forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the admittance of any
theory but our old tradition? The more we read, and the more we
think—think as becomes the readers of Homer,—the more rooted
becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance,
whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its preservation, let us rather be
thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use,
than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories,
whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.
</p>

<p>
As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not included
in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief account of the
Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer who has done it full
justice<a href="#fn37" name="fnref37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>:—
</p>

<p>
“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of
ancient date. The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed
and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile
essay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,
mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the
appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain;
so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know or care about
that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient
writings. As to this little poem being a youthful profusion of Homer, it seems
sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable
parody, not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the
Iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it,
the objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to
be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in
the development of national taste, which the history of every other people in
Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to be a law of the human
mind; it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that
described in the Iliad, that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war
and the gods as is contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed
three other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as
much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were
of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word deltos,
“writing tablet,” instead of
διφθέρα, “skin,” which,
according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for
that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and
generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument
against so ancient a date for its composition.”

Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s
design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my
own purpose in the present edition.
</p>

<p>
Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his
earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It is
not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to
be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute
and delicate features of language. Hence his whole work is to be looked upon
rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure,
certain conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various
friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the
undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather
of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a
perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called literal
translation was less cultivated than at present. If something like the general
sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the
charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with
a fair interpretation of the poet’s meaning, his <i>words</i> were less
jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope’s
Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.
</p>

<p>
It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own
advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at it as a
most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part of English
literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn from our kindly
associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or
our most looked-for prize, merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have
made us so much more accurate as to
ἀμφικύπελλον
being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from us to defend the
faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s fine, bold, rough
old English;—far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a
translation of Homer <i>might</i> be. But we can still dismiss Pope’s
Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must have
read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow.

As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without
pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader. Having some
little time since translated all the works of Homer for another publisher, I
might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter, sometimes of a
critical character, to bear upon the text. But Pope’s version was no
field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or
mythological allusions, to notice occasionally <i>some</i> departures from the
original, and to give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton.
In the latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other
annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be found to
convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary limits of these
volumes could be expected to admit. To write a commentary on Homer is not my
present aim; but if I have made Pope’s translation a little more
entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall
consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished.
