“What,” says Archdeacon Wilberforce, “is the natural root of
loyalty as distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as
is apt to take its place in civilized times, but that consciousness of a
natural bond among the families of men which gives a fellow-feeling to whole
clans and nations, and thus enlists their affections in behalf of those
time-honoured representatives of their ancient blood, in whose success they
feel a personal interest? Hence the delight when we recognize an act of
nobility or justice in our hereditary princes

“So strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even
when history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it and the
Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our own days towards
the granddaughter of George the Third of Hanover.<br/>
    “Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those
great lawgivers of man’s race, who have given expression, in the immortal
language of song, to the deeper inspirations of our nature. The thoughts of
Homer or of Shakespere are the universal inheritance of the human race. In this
mutual ground every man meets his brother, they have been set forth by the
providence of God to vindicate for all of us what nature could effect, and
that, in these representatives of our race, we might recognize our common
benefactors.’—<i>Doctrine of the Incarnation</i>, pp. 9, 10.

    “The voice,” observes Heeren, “was always accompanied by
some instrument. The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a
prelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he accompanied the
song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between singing and
recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by the listeners, hence
it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to all. In countries where
nothing similar is found, it is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind;
but whoever has had an opportunity of listening to the improvisation of Italy,
can easily form an idea of Demodocus and Phemius.”—<i>Ancient
Greece</i>, p. 94.

“Should it not be, since <i>my</i> arrival? asks Mackenzie, observing
that “poplars can hardly live so long”. But setting aside the fact
that we must not expect consistency in a mere romance, the ancients had a
superstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near places
consecrated by the presence of gods and great men. See Cicero de Legg II I, sub
init., where he speaks of the plane tree under which Socrates used to walk and
of the tree at Delos, where Latona gave birth to Apollo. This passage is
referred to by Stephanus of Byzantium, <i>s. v.</i> N. T. p. 490, ed. de
Pinedo. I omit quoting any of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for, as Mr.
Justice Talfourd rightly observes, “The authenticity of these fragments
depends upon that of the pseudo Herodotean Life of Homer, from which they are
taken.” Lit of Greece, pp. 38 in Encycl. Metrop. Cf. Coleridge, Classic
Poets, p. 317.

This is so pretty a picture of early manners and hospitality, that it is almost
a pity to find that it is obviously a copy from the Odyssey. See the fourteenth
book. In fact, whoever was the author of this fictitious biography, he showed
some tact in identifying Homer with certain events described in his poems, and
in eliciting from them the germs of something like a personal narrative.

It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the memory may be
cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to that of any first rate
actor, who must be prepared, at a very short warning, to
‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when laid together,
would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is nothing to two
instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a gentleman of the highest
intellectual attainments, and who held a distinguished rank among the men of
letters in the last century, he informed us that the day before he had passed
much time in examining a man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat
the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also
to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or
backwards, or from the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and even
lines—in short, whatever the passage required; the memory, which seemed
to cling to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect
command, that it could produce it under any form. Our informant went on to
state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in
the same manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which
we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years ago to
visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person can have forgotten the
poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually repeat, after a few minutes
consideration any verse required from any part of the Bible—even the
obscurest and most unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted.
We do not mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the
question before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in
calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in
these days of multifarious reading, and of countless distracting affairs, fair
judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory combined may
attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded people?—Quarterly
Review, <i>l. c.</i>, p. 143, sqq.<br/>
    Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, “The
Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in length,
as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists only in the
memory of a people which is not unacquainted with writing. But the songs of a
nation are probably the last things which are committed to writing, for the
very reason that they are remembered.”— <i>Ancient Greece</i>. p.
100.

The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few particulars, is
translated from Bitaubé, and is, perhaps, the neatest summary that has ever
been drawn up:—“A hero, injured by his general, and animated with a
noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a season withdraws himself and
his troops from the war. During this interval, victory abandons the army, which
for nine years has been occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful
termination of which the honour of their country depends. The general, at
length opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the
principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to make
compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents. The hero,
according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists in his animosity;
the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of entire destruction. This
inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps before him, and asks for the
hero’s arms, and for permission to go to the war in his stead. The
eloquence of friendship prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors
or the gifts of the general. He lends his armour to his friend, but commands
him not to engage with the chief of the enemy’s army, because he reserves
to himself the honour of that combat, and because he also fears for his
friend’s life. The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to
nothing but his courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and the
hero’s arms become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to
the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new
armour, is reconciled with his general and, thirsting for glory and revenge,
enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the enemy’s
chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and exercises a cruel
vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but finally appeased by the tears and
prayers of the father of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse
of his son, which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p.
177, sqq.

<i>Smintheus</i> an epithet taken from sminthos, the Phrygian name for a
<i>mouse</i>, was applied to Apollo for having put an end to a plague of mice
which had harassed that territory. Strabo, however, says, that when the Teucri
were migrating from Crete, they were told by an oracle to settle in that place,
where they should not be attacked by the original inhabitants of the land, and
that, having halted for the night, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away
the leathern straps of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment
of the oracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to Sminthean
Apollo. Grote, “History of Greece,” i. p. 68, remarks that the
“worship of Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its
neighboring territory, dates before the earliest period of Æolian
colonization.”

<i>Bent was his bow</i> “The Apollo of Homer, it must be borne in mind,
is a different character from the deity of the same name in the later classical
pantheon. Throughout both poems, all deaths from unforeseen or invisible
causes, the ravages of pestilence, the fate of the young child or promising
adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or flower of youth, of the old man
dropping peacefully into the grave, or of the reckless sinner suddenly checked
in his career of crime, are ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The
oracular functions of the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental
attributes, for who could more appropriately impart to mortals what little
foreknowledge Fate permitted of her decrees than the agent of her most awful
dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song explains his
additional office of god of music, while the arrows with which he and his
sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every age, no less naturally
procured him that of god of archery. Of any connection between Apollo and the
Sun, whatever may have existed in the more esoteric doctrine of the Greek
sanctuaries, there is no trace in either Iliad or Odyssey.”—Mure,
“History of Greek Literature,” vol. i. p. 478, sq.

The Myrmidons dwelt on the southern borders of Thessaly, and took their origin
from Myrmido, son of Jupiter and Eurymedusa. It is fancifully supposed that the
name was derived from myrmaex, an <i>ant</i>, “because they imitated the
diligence of the ants, and like them were indefatigable, continually employed
in cultivating the earth; the change from ants to men is founded merely on the
equivocation of their name, which resembles that of the ant: they bore a
further resemblance to these little animals, in that instead of inhabiting
towns or villages, at first they commonly resided in the open fields, having no
other retreats but dens and the cavities of trees, until Ithacus brought them
together, and settled them in more secure and comfortable
habitations.”—Anthon’s “Lempriere.”

withdrawing his services. The same idea is rather cleverly worked out by

It has been observed that the annual procession of the sacred ship so often
represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return of the deity from Ethiopia
after some days’ absence, serves to show the Ethiopian origin of Thebes,
and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. “I think,” says Heeren, after
quoting a passage from Diodorus about the holy ship, “that this
procession is represented in one of the great sculptured reliefs on the temple
of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon is on the shore with its whole equipment,
and is towed along by another boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must
have been one of the most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the
interpretation of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of
Jupiter’s visit to the Ethiopians, and his twelve days’
absence.”—Long, “Egyptian Antiquities” vol. 1 p. 96.

The occasion on which Vulcan incurred Jove’s displeasure was
this—After Hercules, had taken and pillaged Troy, Juno raised a storm,
which drove him to the island of Cos, having previously cast Jove into a sleep,
to prevent him aiding his son. Jove, in revenge, fastened iron anvils to her
feet, and hung her from the sky, and Vulcan, attempting to relieve her, was
kicked down from Olympus in the manner described. The allegorists have gone mad
in finding deep explanations for this amusing fiction. See Heraclides,
“Ponticus,” p. 463 sq., ed Gale. The story is told by Homer himself
in Book xv. The Sinthians were a race of robbers, the ancient inhabitants of
Lemnos which island was ever after sacred to Vulcan.

It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting and contemptible
as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition of Ulysses in a new
light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of the gradual and individual
development of Homer’s heroes, Schlegel well observes, “In
bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and in the epos all are
characterized in the simplest manner in relief; they are not grouped together,
but follow one another; so Homer’s heroes advance, one by one, in
succession before us. It has been remarked that the <i>Iliad</i> is not
definitively closed, but that we are left to suppose something both to precede
and to follow it. The bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued
<i>ad infinitum</i>, either from before or behind, on which account the
ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension,
sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants, and hence they also
exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a
rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our sight,
and where, while we advance, one object appears as another disappears. Reading
Homer is very much like such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our
attention, we lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about
what is to follow.”—“Dramatic Literature,” p. 75.

“There cannot be a clearer indication than this description —so

The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent, not often
hesitating, and never refractory to the chief. The fate which awaits a
presumptuous critic, even where his virulent reproaches are substantially
well-founded, is plainly set forth in the treatment of Thersites; while the
unpopularity of such a character is attested even more by the excessive pains
which Homer takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities, than by the
chastisement of Odysseus he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and
squinting vision.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 97.

The following observation will be useful to Homeric readers: “Particular
animals were, at a later time, consecrated to particular deities. To Jupiter,
Ceres, Juno, Apollo, and Bacchus victims of advanced age might be offered. An
ox of five years old was considered especially acceptable to Jupiter. A black
bull, a ram, or a boar pig, were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep,
for Minerva. To Ceres a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to
Bacchus, because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to
Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be
appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices was the
heifer of a year old, which had never borne the yoke. It was to be perfect in
every limb, healthy, and without blemish.”—“Elgin

<i>Scamander</i>, or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising, according to
Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same hill with the Granicus
and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at Sigaeum; everything tends to
identify it with Mendere, as Wood, Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is
40 miles long, 300 feet broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the
summer. Dr. Clarke successfully combats the opinion of those who make the
Scamander to have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source
of the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy;
receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy, and
flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer’s Troy is
supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was called Xanthus by
the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the Scamander had the singular
property of giving a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such animals as
bathed in them; hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed
there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name
Xanthus, “yellow,” was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar
colour of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of
whose waters attracts the attention of travellers.

“The Catalogue is, perhaps, the portion of the poem in favour of which a
claim to separate authorship has been most plausibly urged. Although the
example of Homer has since rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces
engaged, a common practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike
adventures, still so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as
imperatively required, nor perhaps such as would, in ordinary cases, suggest
itself to the mind of a poet. Yet there is scarcely any portion of the Iliad
where both historical and internal evidence are more clearly in favour of a
connection from the remotest period, with the remainder of the work. The
composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place, necessarily
presumes its author’s acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad. It
were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the
recurrence of so vast a number of proper names, most of them historically
unimportant, and not a few altogether fictitious: or of so many geographical
and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines, and
incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow: equally inexplicable
were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the
previous and subsequent text, several of which could hardly be of traditional
notoriety, but through the medium of the Iliad.”—Mure,

<i>Twice Sixty:</i> “Thucydides observes that the Bœotian vessels, which
carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to be the largest
in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty each, the smallest. The
average would be eighty-five, and Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed
and navigated themselves; and that very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere
passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the Homeric descriptions the
complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe, many of which are
considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks. If
the total number of the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to
Thucydides, although in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and
eighty-six in the Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the foregoing
average, will be about a hundred and two thousand men. The historian considers
this a small force as representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it with the
allied army at Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of
the whole story; and his reasonings and calculations are, for their curiosity,
well worth a careful perusal.”—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.

The early epic was largely occupied with the exploits and sufferings of women,
or heroines, the wives and daughters of the Grecian heroes. A nation of
courageous, hardy, indefatigable women, dwelling apart from men, permitting
only a short temporary intercourse, for the purpose of renovating their
numbers, burning out their right breast with a view of enabling themselves to
draw the bow freely; this was at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy
of the poet, and a theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these
warlike females constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and universally
accepted as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes to illustrate
emphatically the most numerous host in which he ever found himself included, he
tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the banks of the Sangarius, for
the purpose of resisting the formidable Amazons. When Bellerophon is to be
employed in a deadly and perilous undertaking, by those who prudently wished to
procure his death, he is despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p.
289.

highly prized and consulted by all the wounded chiefs. Their medical renown was
further prolonged in the subsequent poem of Arktinus, the Iliou Persis, wherein

sagacious in detecting and appreciating morbid symptoms. It was Podaleirius who
first noticed the glaring eyes and disturbed deportment which preceded the
suicide of Ajax.<br/>
    “Galen appears uncertain whether Asklepius (as well as Dionysus) was
originally a god, or whether he was first a man and then became afterwards a
god; but Apollodorus professed to fix the exact date of his apotheosis.
Throughout all the historical ages the descendants of Asklepius were numerous
and widely diffused. The many families or gentes, called Asklepiads, who
devoted themselves to the study and practice of medicine, and who principally
dwelt near the temples of Asklepius, whither sick and suffering men came to
obtain relief—all recognized the god not merely as the object of their
common worship, but also as their actual progenitor.”—Grote vol. i.

The manner in which this episode is introduced, is well illustrated by the
following remarks of Mure, vol. i. p.298: “The poet’s method of
introducing his episode, also, illustrates in a curious manner his tact in the
dramatic department of his art. Where, for example, one or more heroes are
despatched on some commission, to be executed at a certain distance of time or
place, the fulfilment of this task is not, as a general rule, immediately
described. A certain interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene
of action, which interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary
continuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a while on
some new transaction, at the close of which the further account of the mission
is resumed.”

public offences. It may have been originally connected with the same
feeling—the desire of avoiding the pollution of bloodshed—which
seems to have suggested the practice of burying prisoners alive, with a
scantling of food by their side. Though Homer makes no mention of this horrible
usage, the example of the Roman Vestals affords reasons for believing that, in
ascribing it to the heroic ages, Sophocles followed an authentic

<i>Paris’ lofty dome</i>. “With respect to the private dwellings,
which are oftenest described, the poet’s language barely enables us to
form a general notion of their ordinary plan, and affords no conception of the
style which prevailed in them or of their effect on the eye. It seems indeed
probable, from the manner in which he dwells on their metallic ornaments that
the higher beauty of proportion was but little required or understood, and it
is, perhaps, strength and convenience, rather than elegance, that he means to
commend, in speaking of the fair house which Paris had built for himself with
the aid of the most skilful masons of Troy.”—Thirlwall’s
Greece, vol. i. p. 231.

<i>Embattled walls.</i> “Another essential basis of mechanical unity in
the poem is the construction of the rampart. This takes place in the seventh
book. The reason ascribed for the glaring improbability that the Greeks should
have left their camp and fleet unfortified during nine years, in the midst of a
hostile country, is a purely poetical one: ‘So long as Achilles fought,
the terror of his name sufficed to keep every foe at a distance.’ The
disasters consequent on his secession first led to the necessity of other means
of protection. Accordingly, in the battles previous to the eighth book, no
allusion occurs to a rampart; in all those which follow it forms a prominent
feature. Here, then, in the anomaly as in the propriety of the Iliad, the
destiny of Achilles, or rather this peculiar crisis of it, forms the pervading
bond of connexion to the whole poem.”—Mure, vol. i., p. 257.

“A similar bond of connexion, in the military details of the narrative,
is the decree issued by Jupiter, at the commencement of the eighth book,
against any further interference of the gods in the battles. In the opening of
the twentieth book this interdict is withdrawn. During the twelve intermediate
books it is kept steadily in view. No interposition takes place but on the part
of the specially authorised agents of Jove, or on that of one or two
contumacious deities, described as boldly setting his commands at defiance, but
checked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divine
warriors, who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in support of
their favourite heroes, repeatedly allude to the supreme edict as the cause of
their present inactivity.”—Mure, vol. i. p 257. See however,

“Some of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to imply
that he considered it as a solid vault of metal. But it is not necessary to
construe these epithets so literally, nor to draw any such inference from his
description of Atlas, who holds the lofty pillars which keep earth and heaven
asunder. Yet it would seem, from the manner in which the height of heaven is
compared with the depth of Tartarus, that the region of light was thought to
have certain bounds. The summit of the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the
highest point on the earth, and it is not always carefully distinguished from
the aerian regions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps derived
from a more ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to any geographical
site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet’s mind with that
of the real mountain.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 217,

Grote, vol. ii. p. 91, after noticing the modest calmness and respect with

In the heroic times, it is not unfrequent for the king to receive presents to
purchase freedom from his wrath, or immunity from his exactions. Such gifts
gradually became regular, and formed the income of the German, (Tacit. Germ.
Section 15) Persian, (Herodot. iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle
ages, ‘The feudal aids are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a
long time answered the purpose.’ (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p.
189) This fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato,
however, (De Rep. vi. 4), says, “We cannot commend Phœnix, the tutor of
Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of presents
and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist from his wrath, nor
again, should we commend Achilles himself, or approve of his being so covetous
as to receive presents from Agamemnon,” &amp;c.

It may be observed, that, brief as is the mention of Briseïs in the Iliad, and

It must be recollected, that the war at Troy was not a settled siege, and that
many of the chieftains busied themselves in piratical expeditions about its
neighborhood. Such a one was that of which Achilles now speaks. From the

was a sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. “As long as the
channels of these waters were diligently watched and kept clear, a large
portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial land, pre-eminently rich
and fertile. But when the channels came to be either neglected, or designedly
choked up by an enemy, the water accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the
soil of more than one ancient islet, and to occasion the change of the site of
Orchomenus itself from the plain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion.”

<i>And Minos</i>. “By Homer, Minos is described as the son of Jupiter,
and of the daughter of Phœnix, whom all succeeding authors name Europa; and he
is thus carried back into the remotest period of Cretan antiquity known to the
poet, apparently as a native hero, Illustrious enough for a divine parentage,
and too ancient to allow his descent to be traced to any other source. But in a
genealogy recorded by later writers, he is likewise the adopted son of
Asterius, as descendant of Dorus, the son of Helen, and is thus connected with
a colony said to have been led into Creta by Tentamus, or Tectamus, son of
Dorus, who is related either to have crossed over from Thessaly, or to have
embarked at Malea after having led his followers by land into
Laconia.”—Thirlwall, p. 136, seq.

<i>His best beloved</i>. The following elegant remarks of Thirlwall (Greece,
vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character of the friendship subsisting
between these two heroes—<br/>
    “One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character, is
the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and durable
friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in the earliest than in
later times. It was indeed connected with the comparatively low estimation in
which female society was held; but the devotedness and constancy with which
these attachments were maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The
heroic companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in
traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling,
seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and
only to live as they are always ready to die for one another. It is true that
the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but this is a
circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical
description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents.
Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of
Orestes and Pylades; and though These may owe the greater part of their fame to
the later epic or even dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly
subsisted in the period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of
the Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love
for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his
unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus and Meriones,
Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves are less important,
it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the
same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought complete,
without such a brother in arms by his side.”—Thirlwall, Greece,
vol. i. p. 176, seq.

<i>The destinies ordain</i>.—“In the mythology, also, of the Iliad,
purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously involved,
which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and
credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as
omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the
father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be the
true character of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that the student
of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the
Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter laments
to Juno the approaching death of Sarpedon. ‘Alas me!’ says he
‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should be
slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is divided within me
while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having snatched him up from out of the
lamentable battle, I should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of
his own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of
Menoetius!’ To which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue
from death a mortal man, long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You
may do it—but we, the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here
it is clear from both speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to
die, Jupiter might still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out
of the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter
himself would destroy him by the hands of another.”—Coleridge, p.
156. seq.

<i>Thrice at the battlements</i>. “The art military of the Homeric age is
upon a level with the state of navigation just described, personal prowess
decided every thing; the night attack and the ambuscade, although much
esteemed, were never upon a large scale. The chiefs fight in advance, and enact
almost as much as the knights of romance. The siege of Troy was as little like
a modern siege as a captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention
of a ditch or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself was
accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with a
declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans are in no
respects blockaded, and receive assistance from their allies to the very
end.”—Coleridge, p. 212.

“In the wide circle of the shield were seen<br/>
Refulgent images of various forms,<br/>
The work of Vulcan; who had there described<br/>
The heaven, the ether, and the earth and sea,<br/>
The winds, the clouds, the moon, the sun, apart<br/>
In different stations; and you there might view<br/>
The stars that gem the still-revolving heaven,<br/>
And, under them, the vast expanse of air,<br/>
In which, with outstretch’d wings, the long-beak’d bird<br/>
Winnow’d the gale, as if instinct with life.<br/>
Around the shield the waves of ocean flow’d,<br/>
The realms of Tethys, which unnumber’d streams,<br/>
In azure mazes rolling o’er the earth,<br/>
Seem’d to augment.”

Coleridge (Greek Classic Poets, p. 182, seq.) has diligently compared this with
the description of the shield of Hercules by Hesiod. He remarks that,
“with two or three exceptions, the imagery differs in little more than
the names and arrangements; and the difference of arrangement in the Shield of
Hercules is altogether for the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric
images needs no exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the
work. The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity:
Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and
Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the
Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we
are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over an arm
of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes, and the
fisherman on the shore with his casting net, are minutely represented. As to
the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark is, that they catch at
beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable
supposition of the genuineness of this poem, there is this curious peculiarity,
that, in the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is
decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps,
that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.”

“This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the
Grecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas familiar to

endurances of Heracles, the most renowned subjugator of all the semi-divine
personages worshipped by the Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and
especially beloved by Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and
to obey the commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His recompense is
reserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting trials are brought to
a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and receives in marriage
Hebe.”—Grote, vol. i. p. 128.

“Perhaps the boldest excursion of Homer into this region of poetical
fancy is the collision into which, in the twenty-first of the Iliad, he has
brought the river god Scamander, first with Achilles, and afterwards with
Vulcan, when summoned by Juno to the hero’s aid. The overwhelming fury of
the stream finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain
torrents of Greece and Asia Minor. Their wide, shingly beds are in summer
comparatively dry, so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger. But a
thunder-shower in the mountains, unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the
plain, may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of
Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready
explanation from physical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at the
critical moment when the hero’s destruction appeared imminent, might, by
a slight extension of the figurative parallel, be ascribed to a god symbolic of
the influences opposed to all atmospheric moisture.”—Mure, vol. i.

“An ancient forest, for the work design’d<br/>
(The shady covert of the savage kind).<br/>
The Trojans found: the sounding axe is placed:<br/>
Firs, pines, and pitch-trees, and the tow’ring pride<br/>
Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<br/>
And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<br/>
High trunks of trees, fell’d from the steepy crown<br/>
Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.”<br/>

Dryden’s Virgil, vi. 261.

Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better moral from this
episode than Homer. The following lines deserve comparison:—<br/>
<br/>
“The haughty Dares in the lists appears:<br/>
Walking he strides, his head erected bears:<br/>
His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<br/>
And loud applauses echo through the field.<br/>
* * * *<br/>
Such Dares was, and such he strode along,<br/>
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng<br/>
His brawny breast and ample chest he shows;<br/>
His lifted arms around his head he throws,<br/>
And deals in whistling air his empty blows.<br/>
His match is sought, but, through the trembling band,<br/>
No one dares answer to the proud demand.<br/>
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,<br/>
Already he devours the promised prize.<br/>
* * * *<br/>
If none my matchless valour dares oppose,<br/>
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?”<br/>
<br/>
Dryden’s Virgil, v. 486, seq.

“The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore<br/>
His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<br/>
His mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple flood,<br/>
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.”<br/>

Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of Gabriel,
“Paradise Lost,” bk. v. 266, seq.<br/>
<br/>
“Down thither prone in flight<br/>
He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br/>
Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,<br/>
Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan<br/>
Winnows the buxom air. * * * *<br/>
* * * *<br/>
At once on th’ eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br/>
A seraph wing’d. * * * *<br/>
Like Maia’s son he stood,<br/>
And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill’d<br/>
The circuit wide.”<br/>
<br/>
Virgil, Æn. iv. 350:—<br/>
<br/>
“Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<br/>
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<br/>
And whether o’er the seas or earth he flies,<br/>
With rapid force they bear him down the skies<br/>
But first he grasps within his awful hand<br/>
The mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;<br/>
With this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;<br/>
With this he drives them from the Stygian waves:<br/>
* * * *<br/>
Thus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,v And drives the racking clouds
along the liquid space.”<br/>
<br/>
Dryden.

<a name="fn295"></a> <a href="#fnref295">[295]</a> In reference to the whole
scene that follows, the remarks of Coleridge are well worth
reading:—<br/>
    “By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of
expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and
difficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the completest
success. The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when the latter comes to
the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the
most profoundly skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the
Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of Priam, the
rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if genius did not often,
especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of
criticism, we might be induced, on this account alone, to consider the last
book of the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date
than the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying
the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in
gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and, lastly,
mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is softened, and
then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror. The ego
d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha geronta, are not exactly like
the tone of the earlier parts of the Iliad. They are almost too fine and
pathetic. The whole passage defies translation, for there is that about the
Greek which has no name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that
it can only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it
into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.

“Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but
offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic age, however,
must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive vengeance on the dead, as
well as the living, was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous
times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a
solace to the injured man; but made the welfare of the soul after death
dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial
of the rites essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured
regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary
shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to
Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how
efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in
satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death, was supposed to
torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to
Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his
just rights of retribution.”—Mure, vol. i. 289.

The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting
view of Helen’s character—<br/>
    “Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand
that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the
consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad a genuine
lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her associations, full of remorse
for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and
affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have
always thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and hints at
her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest
passage in the poem. It is another striking instance of that refinement of
feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of
the Iliad from the rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.

“And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt
and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied him through the
effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of his stormy passions. We now
leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable
affections, while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the
reflection that, within a few short days the mighty being in whom they were
united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their
exercise.<br/>
    The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad, to
the speedy termination of its hero’s course, and the moral on the vanity
of human life which they indicate, are among the finest evidences of the spirit
of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is
united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201.

Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without
expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is like the
exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained magnificently;
neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet without much
ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination of
“Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.
